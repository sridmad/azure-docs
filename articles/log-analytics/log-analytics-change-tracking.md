# Track software changes in your environment with the Change Tracking solution

![Change Tracking symbol](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/change-tracking-symbol.png)

This article helps you use the Change Tracking solution in Log Analytics to easily identify changes in your environment. The solution tracks changes to Windows and Linux software, Windows files and registry keys, Windows services, and Linux daemons. Identifying configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues.

You install the solution to update the type of agent that you have installed. Changes to installed software, Windows services, and Linux daemons on the monitored servers are read. Then, the data is sent to the Log Analytics service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the received data and the cloud service records the data. By using the information on the Change Tracking dashboard, you can easily see the changes that were made in your server infrastructure.

## Installing and configuring the solution
Use the following information to install and configure the solution.

* You must have a [Windows](log-analytics-windows-agents.md), [Operations Manager](log-analytics-om-agents.md), or [Linux](log-analytics-linux-agents.md) agent on each computer where you want to monitor changes.
* Add the Change Tracking solution to your OMS workspace from the [Azure marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.ChangeTrackingOMS?tab=Overview). Or, you can add the solution using the information in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md). No further configuration is required.

### Configure Linux files to track
Use the following steps to configure files to track on Linux computers.

1. In the OMS portal, click **Settings** (the gear symbol).
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Data**, and then click **Linux File Tracking**.
3. Under Linux File Change Tracking, type the entire path, including the file name of the file that you want to track and then click the **Add** symbol. For example: "/etc/*.conf"
4. Click **Save**.  

> [!NOTE]
> Linux file tracking has additional capabilities including directory tracking, recursion through directories, and wildcard tracking.

### Configure Windows files to track
Use the following steps to configure files to track on Windows computers.

1. In the OMS portal, click **Settings** (the gear symbol).
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Data**, and then click **Windows File Tracking**.
3. Under Windows File Change Tracking, type the entire path, including the file name of the file that you want to track and then click the **Add** symbol. For example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts.
4. Click **Save**. Â

### Configure Windows registry keys to track
Use the following steps to configure registry keys to track on Windows computers.

1. In the OMS portal, click **Settings** (the gear symbol).
2. On the **Settings** page, click **Data**, and then click **Windows Registry Tracking**.
3. Under Windows Registry Change Tracking, type the entire key that you want to track and then click the **Add** symbol.
4. Click **Save**.

### Explanation of Linux File Collection Properties
1. **Type**
   * **File** (Report file metadata - size, modification date, hash, etc.)
   * **Directory** (Report directory metadata - size, modification date, etc.)
2. **Links** (Handling Linux symlink references to other files or directories)
   * **Ignore** (Ignore symlinks during recursion to not include the files/directories referenced)
   * **Follow** (Follow the symlinks during recursion to also include the files/directories referenced)
   * **Manage** (Follow the symlinks and alter the treatment of returned content)

   > [!NOTE]   
   > The "Manage" links option is not recommended. File content retrieval is not supported.

3. **Recurse** (Recurse through folder levels and track all files meeting the path statement)
4. **Sudo** (Enable access files or directories that require sudo privilege)

### Limitations
The Change Tracking solution does not currently support the following items:

* Folders (directories) for Windows File Tracking
* Recursion for Windows File Tracking
* Wild cards for Windows File Tracking
* Path variables
* Network file systems
* File Content

Other limitations:

* The **Max File Size** column and values are unused in the current implementation.
* If you collect more than 2500 files in the 30-minute collection cycle, solution performance might be degraded.
* When network traffic is high, change records may take up to a maximum of six hours to display.
* If you modify the configuration while a computer is shut down, the computer might post file changes that belonged to the previous configuration.

### Known Issues
The Change Tracking solution is currently experiencing the following issues:
* Hotfix updates are not collected for Windows 10 Creators Update and Windows Server 2016 Core RS3 machines.

## Change Tracking data collection details
Change Tracking collects software inventory and Windows Service metadata using the agents that you have enabled.

The following table shows data collection methods and other details about how data is collected for Change Tracking.

| platform | Direct Agent | Operations Manager agent | Linux agent | Azure Storage | Operations Manager required? | Operations Manager agent data sent via management group | Collection frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows and Linux | &#8226; | &#8226; | &#8226; |  |  | &#8226; | 5 minutes to 50 minutes, depending on the change type. For more information, view the following table. |


The following table shows the data collection frequency for the types of changes.

| **change type** | **frequency** | **Does**  **agent**  **send differences when found?** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows registry | 50 minutes | No |
| Windows file | 30 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Linux file | 15 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Windows services | 30 minutes | Yes, every 30 minutes when changes are found. Every 24 hours a snapshot is sent, regardless of change. So, the snapshot is sent even where there are no changes. |
| Linux daemons | 5 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |
| Windows software | 30 minutes | Yes, every 30 minutes when changes are found. Every 24 hours a snapshot is sent, regardless of change. So, the snapshot is sent even where there are no changes. |
| Linux software | 5 minutes | Yes. If there is no change in 24 hours, a snapshot is sent. |

### Registry key change tracking

Log Analytics performs Windows registry monitoring and tracking with the Change Tracking solution.
