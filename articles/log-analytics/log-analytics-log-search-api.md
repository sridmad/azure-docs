# Log Analytics log search REST API
This guide provides a basic tutorial, including examples, of how you can use the Log Analytics Search REST API. Log Analytics is part of the Operations Management Suite (OMS).

> [!NOTE]
> If your workspace has been upgraded to the [new Log Analytics query language](log-analytics-log-search-upgrade.md), then you should refer to the [documentation for the new version of the log search API](https://dev.loganalytics.io/).

> [!NOTE]
> Log Analytics was previously called Operational Insights, which is why it is the name used in the resource provider.
>
>

## Overview of the Log Search REST API
The Log Analytics Search REST API is RESTful and can be accessed via the Azure Resource Manager API. This article provides examples of accessing the API through [ARMClient](https://github.com/projectkudu/ARMClient), an open source command-line tool that simplifies invoking the Azure Resource Manager API. The use of ARMClient is one of many options to access the Log Analytics Search API. Another option is to use the Azure PowerShell module for OperationalInsights, which includes cmdlets for accessing search. With these tools, you can utilize the Azure Resource Manager API to make calls to OMS workspaces and perform search commands within them. The API outputs search results in JSON format, allowing you to use the search results in many different ways programmatically.

The Azure Resource Manager can be used via a [Library for .NET](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn910477.aspx) and the [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163658.aspx). To learn more, review the linked web pages.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use an aggregation command such as `|measure count()` or `distinct`, each call to search can return upto 500,000 records. Searches that do not include an aggregation command return upto 5,000 records.

## Basic Log Analytics Search REST API tutorial
### To use ARMClient
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), which is an Open Source Package Manager for Windows. Open a command prompt window as administrator and then run the following command:

    ```
    @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin
    ```
2. Install ARMClient by running the following command:

    ```
    choco install armclient
    ```

### To perform a search using ARMClient
1. Log in using your Microsoft account or your work or school account:

    ```
    armclient login
    ```

    A successful login lists all subscriptions tied to the given account:

    ```
    PS C:\Users\SampleUserName> armclient login
    Welcome YourEmail@ORG.com (Tenant: zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz)
    User: YourEmail@ORG.com, Tenant: zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz (Example org)
    There are 3 subscriptions
    Subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (Example Name 1)
    Subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (Example Name 2)
    Subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx (Example Name 3)
    ```
2. Get the Operations Management Suite workspaces:

    ```
    armclient get /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/OI-Default-East-US/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces?api-version=2015-03-20
    ```

    A successful Get call would output all workspaces tied to the subscription:

    ```
    {
    "value": [
    {
      "properties": {
    "source": "External",
    "customerId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    "portalUrl": "https://eus.login.mms.microsoft.com/SignIn.aspx?returnUrl=https%3a%2f%2feus.mms.microsoft.com%2fMain.aspx%3fcid%xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      },
      "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourcegroups/oi-default-east-us/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/{WORKSPACE NAME}",
      "name": "{WORKSPACE NAME}",
      "type": "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces",
      "location": "East US"
       ]
    }
    ```
3. Create your search variable:

    ```
    $mySearch = "{ 'top':150, 'query':'Error'}";
    ```
4. Search using your new search variable:

    ```
    armclient post /subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/OI-Default-East-US/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WORKSPACE NAME}/search?api-version=2015-03-20 $mySearch
    ```

## Log Analytics Search REST API reference examples
The following examples show you how you can use the Search API.

### Search - Action/Read

      }]
    }
```

### Search/{ID} - Action/Read
**Request the contents of a Saved Search:**

```
    armclient post /subscriptions/{SubId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WorkspaceName}/search/{SearchId}?api-version=2015-03-20
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the search returns with a ‘Pending’ status, then polling the updated results can be done through this API. After 6 min, the result of the search will be dropped from the cache and HTTP Gone will be returned. If the initial search request returns a ‘Successful’ status immediately, the results are not added to the cache causing this API to return HTTP Gone if queried. The contents of an HTTP 200 result are in the same format as the initial search request just with updated values.
>
>

### Saved searches
**Request List of Saved Searches:**

```
    armclient post /subscriptions/{SubId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WorkspaceName}/savedSearches?api-version=2015-03-20
```

Supported methods: GET PUT DELETE

Supported collection methods: GET

The following table describes the properties that are available.

| Property | Description |

```

### Metadata - JSON only
Here’s a way to see the fields for all log types for the data collected in your workspace. For example, if you want you know if the Event type has a field named Computer, then this query is one way to check.

**Request for Fields:**

```
    armclient get /subscriptions/{SubId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroupId}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{WorkspaceName}/schema?api-version=2015-03-20
```

**Response:**

```
    {
      "__metadata" : {
        "schema" : {
          "name" : "Example Name",
          "version" : 2
        },

        }, {
          "name" : "ManagementGroupName",
          "displayName" : "ManagementGroupName",
          "type" : "String",
          "facetable" : true,
          "display" : true,
          "ownerType" : ["PerfHourly", "ProtectionStatus", "Event", "ConfigurationChange", "ConfigurationAlert", "W3CIISLog", "AlertHistory", "Recommendation", "Alert", "SecurityEvent", "UpdateAgent", "RequiredUpdate", "ConfigurationObject", "ConfigurationObjectProperty"]
        }
      ]
    }
```

The following table describes the properties that are available.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| name |Field name. |
| displayName |The display name of the field. |
| type |The Type of the field value. |
| facetable |Combination of current ‘indexed’, ‘stored ‘and ‘facet’ properties. |
| display |Current ‘display’ property. True if field is visible in search. |
| ownerType |Reduced to only Types belonging to onboarded IP’s. |

## Optional parameters
The following information describes optional parameters available.

### Highlighting
The “Highlight” parameter is an optional parameter you may use to request the search subsystem include a set of markers in its response.

These markers indicate the start and end highlighted text that matches the terms provided in your search query.
You may specify the start and end markers that are used by search to wrap the highlighted term.

**Example search query**

```
    $savedSearchParametersJson =
    {
      "top":150,
      "highlight":{
        "pre":"{[hl]}",
        "post":"{[/hl]}"
      },
      "query":"*",
      "start":"2015-02-04T21:03:29.231Z",
      "end":"2015-02-11T21:03:29.231Z"
    }
    armclient post /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/OI-Default-East-US/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{Workspace ID}/search?api-version=2015-03-20 $searchParametersJson
```

**Sample result:**

```
    {
        "TimeGenerated":
        "2015-05-18T23:55:59Z", "Source":
        "EventLog": "Application",
        "Computer": "smokedturkey.net",
        "EventCategory": 0,
        "EventLevel":1,
        "EventLevelName":
        "Error"
        "Manager ", "__metadata":
        {
            "Type": "Event",
            "TimeGenerated": "2015-05-18T23:55:59Z",
            "highlighting": {
                "EventLevelName":
                ["{[hl]}Error{[/hl]}"]
            }
        }
    }
```

Notice that the preceding result contains an error message that has been prefixed and appended.

## Computer groups
Computer groups are special saved searches that return a set of computers.  You can use a computer group in other queries to limit the results to the computers in the group.  A computer group is implemented as a saved search with a Group tag with a value of Computer.

Following is a sample response for a computer group.

```
    "etag": "W/\"datetime'2016-04-01T13%3A38%3A04.7763203Z'\"",
    "properties": {
        "Category": "My Computer Groups",
        "DisplayName": "My Computer Group",
        "Query": "srv* | Distinct Computer",
        "Tags": [{
            "Name": "Group",
            "Value": "Computer"
          }],
    "Version": 1
    }
```

### Retrieving computer groups
To retrieve a computer group, use the Get method with the group ID.

```
armclient get /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{Resource Group Name}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{Workspace Name}/savedSearches/{Group ID}`?api-version=2015-03-20
```

### Creating or updating a computer group
To create a computer group, use the Put method with a unique saved search ID. If you use an existing computer group ID, then that one is modified. When you create a computer group in the Log Analytics portal, then the ID is created from the group and name.

The query used for the group definition must return a set of computers for the group to function properly.  It's recommended that you end your query with `| Distinct Computer` to ensure the correct data is returned.

The definition of the saved search must include a tag named Group with a value of Computer for the search to be classified as a computer group.

```
    $etag=Get-Date -Format yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.msZ
    $groupName="My Computer Group"
    $groupQuery = "Computer=srv* | Distinct Computer"
    $groupCategory="My Computer Groups"
    $groupID = "My Computer Groups | My Computer Group"

    $groupJson = "{'etag': 'W/`"datetime\'" + $etag + "\'`"', 'properties': { 'Category': '" + $groupCategory + "', 'DisplayName':'"  + $groupName + "', 'Query':'" + $groupQuery + "', 'Tags': [{'Name': 'Group', 'Value': 'Computer'}], 'Version':'1'  }"

    armclient put /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{Resource Group Name}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{Workspace Name}/savedSearches/$groupId`?api-version=2015-03-20 $groupJson
```

### Deleting computer groups
To delete a computer group, use the Delete method with the group ID.

```
armclient delete /subscriptions/{Subscription ID}/resourceGroups/{Resource Group Name}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{Workspace Name}/savedSearches/$groupId`?api-version=2015-03-20
```
