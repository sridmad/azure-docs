# Manage cost of data retention with your Log Analytics workspace
When you sign up for Log Analytics, depending on the plan you select, there is a limit to how long the data generated by your connected sources is stored in your workspace.  This article highlights the considerations that can influence costs for retaining this data for different periods of time and how to configure that limit.   

Because Log Analytics can consume large amounts of data from sources on-premise, cloud and hybrid environments, the cost of storing that data for a period of time can be considerable depending on the following factors:

* Number of systems, infrastructure components, cloud resources, etc. you are collecting from
* Type of data created by the source, such as message queues, logs, events, security-related data, or performance metrics
* Volume of data generated by these sources 
* Number of Management solution enabled, data source, and collection frequency

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to the documentation for each solution as it provides an estimate of how much data it collects.   

If you are on the *Free* plan, data is limited to seven day retention.  For the *Standalone* or *Paid* tier, data collected is available the last 31 days.  

While using the *Free* plan, if you find you consistently exceed the amounts allowed, you can change your workspace to a paid plan to collect data beyond this limit. 

> [!NOTE]
> Charges apply if you choose to select a longer retention period for the paid tier. You can change your plan type at any time and for more information on pricing, see [pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics/). 

## Change the data retention period 

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). 
2. Click **More services** found on the lower left-hand corner. In the list of resources, type **Log Analytics**. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input. Select **Log Analytics**.
3. In the Log Analytics subscriptions pane, select your workspace to modify from the list.
4. On the Workspace page, click **Retention** from the left-hand pane.
5. On the workspace retention pane, move the slider to increase or decrease the number of days and then click **Save**.  If you are on the *free* tier, you will not be able to modify the data retention period and you need to upgrade to the paid tier in order to control this setting.<br><br> ![Change workspace data retention setting](media/log-analytics-manage-cost/manage-cost-change-retention.png)
