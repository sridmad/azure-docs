# Centrally manage ITSM work items using IT Service Management Connector (Preview)

![IT Service Management Connector symbol](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-symbol.png)

The IT Service Management Connector (ITSMC) provides a bi-directional integration between a supported IT Service Management (ITSM) product/service and Log Analytics.  Through this connection, you can create incidents, alerts, or events in ITSM product based on Log Analytics' alerts, log records or Azure alerts. The connector also imports data such as incidents, and change requests from ITSM product into OMS Log Analytics.

With ITSMC, you can:

  - Integrate operational alerts with your incident management practices in the ITSM tool of your choice.
    - Create work items (like alert, event, incident) in ITSM from OMS alerts and through log search.
    - Create work items based on your Azure Activity Log alerts through ITSM Action in Action Groups.

  - Unify the monitoring, log, and service management data used across your organization.
    - Correlate incident and change request data from your ITSM tooling with relevant log data in Log Analytics workspace.   
    - View top-level dashboards for an overview on incidents, change requests, and impacted systems.
    - Write Log Analytics queries to gain insights into Service Management data.

## Adding the IT Service Management Connector Solution

Add the IT Service Management Connector solution to your Log Analytics work space, using the process described in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).

Here is the ITSMC tile as you see in the Solutions gallery:

![connector tile](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-solutions-tile.png)

After successful addition, you will see the IT Service Management Connector under **OMS** > **Settings** > **Connected Sources.**

![ITSMC Connected](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-overview-solution-in-connected-sources.png)

> [!NOTE]

> By default, ITSMC refreshes the connection's data once in every 24 hours. To refresh your connection's data instantly for any edits or template updates that you make, click the "Refresh" button displayed next to your connection.

 ![ITSMC refresh](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-connection-refresh.png)


## Configuring the ITSMC connection with your ITSM products/services

ITSMC supports connections to **System Center Service Manager**, **ServiceNow**, **Provance**, and **Cherwell**.

Use the following procedures as applicable for you:

- [System Center Service Manager (SCSM)](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#connect-system-center-service-manager-to-it-service-management-connector-in-oms)

- [ServiceNow](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#connect-servicenow-to-it-service-management-connector-in-oms)

- [Provance](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#connect-provance-to-it-service-management-connector-in-oms)  

- [Cherwell](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#connect-cherwell-to-it-service-management-connector-in-oms)

## Using the solution

Once you have configured the connector, it starts gathering the data from the connected ITSM product/service. Depending on the number of incidents and change requests in the ITSM product/service, initial sync should be completed in few minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> - Data imported from ITSM product by ITSMC solution appears in Log Analytics as log records of Type **ServiceDesk_CL**.
> - Log record contains a field named **ServiceDeskWorkItemType_s**, which is either incident or change request, the two kinds of data imported from the ITSM product.

## Data synced from ITSM product
Incidents and change requests are synced from your ITSM product to your Log Analytics workspace.
The following information shows examples of data gathered by ITSMC:

> [!NOTE]

> Depending on the work item type imported into Log Analytics, **ServiceDesk_CL** contains the following fields:

**Work item:** **Incidents**  
ServiceDeskWorkItemType_s="Incident"

## ITSMC integration with other OMS solutions

ITSM connector currently supports integration with the Service Map solution.

Service Map automatically discovers the application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It allows you to view your servers as you think of them â€“ as interconnected systems that deliver critical services. Service Map shows connections between servers, processes, and ports across any TCP-connected architecture with no configuration required other than installation of an agent.

More information: [Service Map](../operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-service-map.md).

If you also use the Service Map solution, you can view the service desk items created in the ITSM solutions as shown in the following example:

![ServiceMap Integration](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-overview-integrated-solutions.png)
## Create ITSM work items for OMS alerts

With ITSMC solution in place, you can configure OMS Alerts to trigger the creation of work items in your connected ITSM tool. Use the following procedure:

1. From **Log Search** window, run a log search query to view data. Query results are the source for work items.
2. In **Log Search**, click **Alert** to open the **Add Alert Rule** page.

    ![Log Analytics screen](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-work-items-for-oms-alerts.png)

3. On the **Add Alert Rule** window, provide the required details for **Name**, **Severity**,  **Search query**, and **Alert criteria** (Time Window/Metric measurement).
4. Select **Yes** for **ITSM Actions**.
5. Select your ITSM connection from the **Select Connection** list.
6. Provide the details as required.
7. To create a separate work item for each log entry of this alert, select the **Create individual work items for each log entry** checkbox.

    Or

    leave this checkbox unselected to create only one work item for any number of log entries under this alert.

7. Click **Save**.

The OMS alert you have created can be seen under **Settings**>**Alerts**. The corresponding ITSM connection's work items are created when the specified alert's condition is met.

## Create ITSM work items from OMS logs

You can also create work items in the connected ITSM sources directly from a log record. Use the following procedure:

1. From **Log Search**,  search the required data, select the detail, and click **Create work item**.

    The **Create ITSM Work Item** window appears:

    ![Log Analytics screen](media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsmc-work-items-from-oms-logs.png)

2.   Add the following details:

  - **Work item Title**: Title for the work item.
  - **Work item Description**: Description for the new work item.
  - **Affected Computer**: Name of the computer where this log data was found.
  - **Select Connection**:  ITSM connection in which you want to create this work item.
  - **Work item**:  Type of work item.

3. To use an existing work item template for an incident, click **Yes** under **Generate Work item based on Template** option and then click **Create**.

    Or,

    Click **No** if you want to provide your customized values.

4. Provide the appropriate values in the **Contact Type**, **Impact**, **Urgency**, **Category**, and **Sub Category** text boxes, and then click **Create**.

## Create ITSM work items from Azure alerts

ITSMC is integrated with Action Groups.

[Action Groups](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-action-groups.md) provide a modular and reusable way of triggering actions for your Azure Alerts. By using the ITSM Action in Action Groups, you can create work items in your ITSM product that has an  existing connection to ITSM connector solution.

Use the following procedure:

1. In Azure portal, click  **Monitor**.
2. In the left pane, click  **Action groups**. The **Add action group** window appears.

    ![Action Groups](media/log-analytics-itsmc/action-groups.png)

3. Provide **Name** and **ShortName** for your action group. Select the **Resource Group** and **Subscription** where you want to create your action group.

    ![Action Groups detail](media/log-analytics-itsmc/action-groups-details.png)

4. In the Actions list, select **ITSM** from the drop-down menu for **Action Type**. Provide a **Name** for the action and click **Edit details**.
5. Select the **Subscription** where your Log Analytics workspace is located. Select the **Connection** name (your ITSM Connector name) followed by your Workspace name. For example, "MyITSMMConnector(MyWorkspace)."

    ![ITSM Action details](./media/log-analytics-itsmc/itsm-action-details.png)

6. Select **Work Item** type from the drop-down menu.
   Choose to use an existing template or fill the fields required by your ITSM product.
7. Click **OK**.

When creating/editing an Azure alert rule, use an Action group, which has an ITSM Action. When the alert triggers, work item is created in the ITSM tool.

>[!NOTE]

> Currently, only Activity Log Alerts support the ITSM Action, Other Azure alerts do not support this.


## Troubleshoot ITSM connections in OMS
1.	If connection fails from connected source's UI with an **Error in saving connection** message, take the following steps:
 - For ServiceNow, Cherwell and Provance connections,
        - ensure you correctly entered  the username, password, client ID, and client secret  for each of the connections.
        - check if you have sufficient privileges in the corresponding ITSM product to make the connection.
 - For Service Manager connections,
        - ensure that the Web app is successfully deployed and hybrid connection is created. To verify the connection is successfully established with the on-prem Service Manager machine, visit the  Web app URL as detailed in the documentation for making the [hybrid connection](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#configure-the-hybrid-connection).

2.	If data from ServiceNow is not getting synced to Log Analytics, ensure that the ServiceNow instance is not sleeping. ServiceNow Dev Instances sometimes go to sleep when idle for a long period. Else, report the issue.
3.	If OMS Alerts fire but work items are not created in ITSM product or configuration items are not created/linked to work items or for any other generic information, look in the following places:
 -  ITSMC: The solution shows a summary of connections/work items/computers etc. Click the tile showing **Connector Status**, which takes you to **Log Search**  with the relevant query. Look at the log records with LogType_S as ERROR for more information.
 - **Log Search** page: view the errors/related information directly using the query *Type=ServiceDeskLog_CL*.

## Troubleshoot Service Manager Web App deployment
1.	In case of any issues with web app deployment, ensure you have sufficient permissions in the subscription mentioned to create/deploy resources.
2.	If you get an **"Object reference not set to instance of an object"** error when you run the [script](log-analytics-itsmc-service-manager-script.md), ensure that you entered valid values  under **User Configuration** section.
3.	If you fail to create service bus relay namespace, ensure that the required resource provider is registered in the subscription. If not registered, manually create service bus relay namespace from the Azure portal. You can also create it while [creating the hybrid connection](log-analytics-itsmc-connections.md#configure-the-hybrid-connection) from the Azure portal.
