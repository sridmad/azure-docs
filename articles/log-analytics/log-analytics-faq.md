# Log Analytics FAQ
This Microsoft FAQ is a list of commonly asked questions about Log Analytics in Microsoft Azure. If you have any additional questions about Log Analytics, go to the [discussion forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=opinsights) and post your questions. When a question is frequently asked, we add it to this article so that it can be found quickly and easily.

## General

### Q. Does Log Analytics use the same agent as Azure Security Center?

A. In early June 2017, Azure Security Center began using the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to collect and store data. To learn more, see [Azure Security Center Platform Migration FAQ](../security-center/security-center-platform-migration-faq.md).

### Q. What checks are performed by the AD and SQL Assessment solutions?

A. The following query shows a description of all checks currently performed:

```
(Type=SQLAssessmentRecommendation OR Type=ADAssessmentRecommendation) | dedup RecommendationId | select FocusArea, ActionArea, Recommendation, Description | sort Type, FocusArea,ActionArea, Recommendation
```

The results can then be exported to Excel for further review.

### Q: Why do I see something different than OMS in the System Center Operations Manager console?

A: Depending on what Update Rollup of Operations Manager you are on, you may see a node for *System Center Advisor*, *Operational Insights*, or *Log Analytics*.

The text string update to *OMS* is included in a management pack, which needs to be imported manually. To see the current text and functionality, follow the instructions on the latest System Center Operations Manager Update Rollup KB article and refresh the console.

### Q: Is there an on-premises version of Log Analytics?

A: No. Log Analytics is a scalable cloud service that processes and stores large amounts of data. 

### Q. How do I troubleshoot if Log Analytics is no longer collecting data?

A: If you are on the free pricing tier and have sent more than 500 MB of data in a day, data collection stops for the rest of the day. Reaching the daily limit is a common reason that Log Analytics stops collecting data, or data appears to be missing.

Log Analytics creates an event of type *Operation* when data collection starts and stops. 

Run the following query in search to check if you are reaching the daily limit and missing data:
`Type=Operation OperationCategory="Data Collection Status"`

When data collection stops, the *OperationStatus* is **Warning**. When data collection starts, the *OperationStatus* is **Succeeded**. 

The following table describes reasons that data collection stops and a suggested action to resume data collection:

| Reason data collection stops                       | To resume data collection |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------  |
| Daily limit of free data reached<sup>1</sup>       | Wait until the following day for collection to automatically restart, or<br> Change to a paid pricing tier |
| Azure subscription is in a suspended state due to: <br> Free trial ended <br> Azure pass expired <br> Monthly spending limit reached (for example on an MSDN or Visual Studio subscription)                          | Convert to a paid subscription <br> Convert to a paid subscription <br> Remove limit, or wait until limit resets |

<sup>1</sup> If your workspace is on the free pricing tier, you're limited to sending 500 MB of data per day to the service. 
When you reach the daily limit, data collection stops until the next day. Data sent while data collection is stopped is not indexed and is not available for searching. When data collection resumes, processing occurs only for new data sent. 

Log Analytics uses UTC time and each day starts at midnight UTC. If the workspace reaches the daily limit, processing resumes during the first hour of the next UTC day.

### Q. How can I be notified when data collection stops?

A: Use the steps described in [create an alert rule](log-analytics-alerts-creating.md#create-an-alert-rule) to be notified when data collection stops.

When creating the alert for when data collection stops, set the:
- **Name** to *Data collection stopped*
- **Severity** to *Warning*
- **Search query** to `Type=Operation OperationCategory="Data Collection Status" OperationStatus=Warning`
- **Time window** to *2 Hours*.
- **Alert frequency** to be one hour since the usage data only updates once per hour.
- **Generate alert based on** to be *number of results*
- **Number of results** to be *Greater than 0*

Use the steps described in [add actions to alert rules](log-analytics-alerts-actions.md) configure an e-mail, webhook, or runbook action for the alert rule.


## Configuration
### Q. Can I change the name of the table/blob container used to read from Azure Diagnostics (WAD)?

A. No, it is not currently possible to read from arbitrary tables or containers in Azure storage.

### Q. What IP addresses does the Log Analytics service use? How do I ensure that my firewall only allows traffic to the Log Analytics service?

A. The Log Analytics service is built on top of Azure. Log Analytics IP addresses are in the [Microsoft Azure Datacenter IP Ranges](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).

As service deployments are made, the actual IP addresses of the Log Analytics service change. The DNS names to allow through your firewall are documented at [Configure proxy and firewall settings in Log Analytics](log-analytics-proxy-firewall.md).

### Q. I use ExpressRoute for connecting to Azure. Does my Log Analytics traffic use my ExpressRoute connection?

A. The different types of ExpressRoute traffic are described in the [ExpressRoute documentation](../expressroute/expressroute-faqs.md#supported-services).

Traffic to Log Analytics uses the public-peering ExpressRoute circuit.

### Q. Is there a simple and easy way to move an existing Log Analytics workspace to another Log Analytics workspace/Azure subscription?

A. The `Move-AzureRmResource` cmdlet lets you move a Log Analytics workspace, and also an Automation account from one Azure subscription to another. For more information, see [Move-AzureRmResource](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt652516.aspx).

This change can also be made in the Azure portal.

You can’t move data from one Log Analytics workspace to another, or change the region that Log Analytics data is stored in.

### Q: How do I add Log Analytics to System Center Operations Manager?

A:  Updating to the latest update rollup and importing management packs enables you to connect Operations Manager to Log Analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>The Operations Manager connection to Log Analytics is only available for System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1 and later.

### Q: How can I confirm that an agent is able to communicate with Log Analytics?

A: To ensure that the agent can communicate with OMS, go to: Control Panel, Security & Settings, **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**.

Under the **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** tab, look for a green check mark. A green check mark icon confirms that the agent is able to communicate with the Azure service.

A yellow warning icon means the agent is having issues communication with Log Analytics. One common reason is the Microsoft Monitoring Agent service has stopped. Use service control manager to restart the service.

### Q: How do I stop an agent from communicating with Log Analytics?

A: In System Center Operations Manager, remove the computer from the OMS managed computers list. Operations Manager updates the configuration of the agent to no longer report to Log Analytics. For agents connected to Log Analytics directly, you can stop them from communicating through: Control Panel, Security & Settings, **Microsoft Monitoring Agent**.
Under **Azure Log Analytics (OMS)**, remove all workspaces listed.

### Q: Why am I getting an error when I try to move my workspace from one Azure subscription to another?

A: If you are using the Azure portal, ensure only the workspace is selected for the move. Do not select the solutions -- they will automatically move after the workspace moves. 

Ensure you have permission in both Azure subscriptions.

## Agent data
### Q. How much data can I send through the agent to Log Analytics? Is there a maximum amount of data per customer?
A. The free plan sets a daily cap of 500 MB per workspace. The standard and premium plans have no limit on the amount of data that is uploaded. As a cloud service, Log Analytics is designed to automatically scale up to handle the volume coming from a customer – even if it is terabytes per day.

The Log Analytics agent was designed to ensure it has a small footprint. One of our customers wrote a blog about the tests they performed against our agent and how impressed they were. The data volume varies based on the solutions you enable. You can find detailed information on the data volume and see the breakup by solution in the [Usage](log-analytics-usage.md) page.

For more information, you can read a [customer blog](http://thoughtsonopsmgr.blogspot.com/2015/09/one-small-footprint-for-server-one.html) about the low footprint of the OMS agent.

### Q. How much network bandwidth is used by the Microsoft Management Agent (MMA) when sending data to Log Analytics?

A. Bandwidth is a function on the amount of data sent. Data is compressed as it is sent over the network.

### Q. How much data is sent per agent?

A. The amount of data sent per agent depends on:

* The solutions you have enabled
* The number of logs and performance counters being collected
* The volume of data in the logs

The free pricing tier is a good way to onboard several servers and gauge the typical data volume. Overall usage is shown on the [Usage](log-analytics-usage.md) page.

For computers that are able to run the WireData agent, use the following query to see how much data is being sent:

```
Type=WireData (ProcessName="C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\\Agent\\MonitoringHost.exe") (Direction=Outbound) | measure Sum(TotalBytes) by Computer
```
