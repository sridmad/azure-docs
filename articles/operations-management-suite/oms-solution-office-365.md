# Office 365 solution in Operations Management Suite (OMS)

![Office 365 logo](media/oms-solution-office-365/icon.png)

The Office 365 solution for Operations Management Suite (OMS) allows you to monitor your Office 365 environment in Log Analytics.  

- Monitor user activities on your Office 365 accounts to analyze usage patterns as well as identify behavioral trends. For example, you can extract specific usage scenarios, such as files that are shared outside your organization or the most popular SharePoint sites.
- Monitor administrator activities to track configuration changes or high privilege operations.
- Detect and investigate unwanted user behavior, which can be customized for your organizational needs.
- Demonstrate audit and compliance. For example, you can monitor file access operations on confidential files, which can help you with the audit and compliance process.
- Perform operational troubleshooting by using OMS Search on top of Office 365 activity data of your organization.

## Prerequisites
The following is required prior to this solution being installed and configured.

- Organizational Office 365 subscription.
- Credentials for a user account that is a Global Administrator.
- To receive audit data, you must [configure auditing](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Search-the-audit-log-in-the-Office-365-Security-Compliance-Center-0d4d0f35-390b-4518-800e-0c7ec95e946c?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US#PickTab=Before_you_begin) in your Office 365 subscription.  Note that [mailbox auditing](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn879651.aspx) is configured separately.  You can still install the solution and collect other data if auditing is not configured.
 


## Management packs
This solution does not install any management packs in connected management groups.
  

## Configuration
Once you [add the Office 365 solution to your subscription](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md), you have to connect it to your Office 365 subscription.

1. Add the Alert Management solution to your OMS workspace using the process described in [Add solutions](../log-analytics/log-analytics-add-solutions.md).
2. Go to **Settings** in the OMS portal.
3. Under **Connected Sources**, select **Office 365**.
4. Click on **Connect Office 365**.<br>![Connnect Office 365](media/oms-solution-office-365/configure.png)
5. Sign in to Office 365 with an account that is a Global Administrator for your subscription. 
6. The subscription will be listed with the workloads that the solution will monitor.<br>![Connnect Office 365](media/oms-solution-office-365/connected.png) 


## Data collection
### Supported agents
The Office 365 solution doesn't retrieve data from any of the [OMS agents](../log-analytics/log-analytics-data-sources.md).  It retrieves data directly from Office 365.

### Collection frequency
Office 365 sends a [webhook notification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office-365/office-365-management-activity-api-reference#receiving-notifications) with detailed data to Log Analytics each time a record is created.

## Using the solution
When you add the Office 365 solution to your OMS workspace, the **Office 365** tile will be added to your OMS dashboard. This tile displays a count and graphical representation of the number of computers in your environment and their update compliance.<br><br>
![Office 365 Summary Tile](media/oms-solution-office-365/tile.png)  

Click on the **Office 365** tile to open the **Office 365** dashboard.

![Office 365 Dashboard](media/oms-solution-office-365/dashboard.png)  

The dashboard includes the columns in the following table. Each column lists the top ten alerts by count matching that column's criteria for the specified scope and time range. You can run a log search that provides the entire list by clicking See all at the bottom of the column or by clicking the column header.

| Column | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Operations | Provides information about the active users from your all monitored Office 365 subscriptions. You will also be able to see the number of activities that happen over time.
| Exchange | Shows the breakdown of Exchange Server activities such as Add-Mailbox Permission, or Set-Mailbox. |
| SharePoint | Shows the top activities that users perform on SharePoint documents. When you drill down from this tile, the search page shows the details of these activities, such as the target document and the location of this activity. For example, for a File Accessed event, you will be able to see the document thatâ€™s being accessed, its associated account name, and IP address. |
| Azure Active Directory | Includes top user activities, such as Reset User Password and Login Attempts. When you drill down, you will be able to see the details of these activities like the Result Status. This is mostly helpful if you want to monitor suspicious activities on your Azure Active Directory. |




## Log Analytics records

All records created in the Log Analytics workspace by the Office 365 solution have a **Type** of **OfficeActivity**.  The **OfficeWorkload** property determines which Office 365 service the record refers to - Exchange, AzureActiveDirectory, SharePoint, or OneDrive.  The **RecordType** property specifies the type of operation.  The properties will vary for each operation type and are shown in the tables below.

## Troubleshooting

If your Office 365 solution is not collecting data as expected, check its status in the OMS portal at **Settings** -> **Connected Sources** -> **Office 365**. The following table describes each status.

| Status | Description |
|:--|:--|
| Active | The Office 365 subscription is active and the workload is successfully connected to your OMS workspace. |
| Pending | The Office 365 subscription is active but the workload is not yet connected to your OMS workspace successfully. The first time you connect the Office 365 subscription, all the workloads will be at this status until they are successfully connected. Please allow 24 hours for all the workloads to switch to Active. |
| Inactive | The Office 365 subscription is in an inactive state. Check your Office 365 Admin page for details. After you activate your Office 365 subscription, unlink it from your OMS workspace and link it again to start receiving data. |



## Next steps
* Use Log Searches in [Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-log-searches.md) to view detailed update data.
* [Create your own dashboards](../log-analytics/log-analytics-dashboards.md) to display your favorite Office 365 search queries.
* [Create alerts](../log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts.md) to be proactively notified of important Office 365 activities.
