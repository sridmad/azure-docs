# Monitor and troubleshoot protection for virtual machines and physical servers
This monitoring and troubleshooting guide helps you learn how to track replication health and troubleshoot techniques for Azure Site Recovery.

## Understand the components
### VMware virtual machine or physical server site deployment for replication between on-premises and Azure
To set up database recovery between an on-premises VMware virtual machine or physical server and Azure, you need to set up the configuration server, master target server, and process server components on your virtual machine or server. When you enable protection for the source server, Azure Site Recovery installs the Mobility Service from the chosen Process server if an up-to-date version is not already deployed. After an on-premises outage and after the source server fails over to Azure, customers need to set up a process server in Azure and a master target server on premises to rebuild the source server on premises.

### Virtual Machine Manager site deployment for replication between on-premises sites
To set up database recovery between two on-premises locations, you need to download the Azure Site Recovery provider and install it on the Virtual Machine Manager server. The provider needs Internet connectivity to ensure that all the operations that are triggered from the Azure portal get translated to on-premises operations.

![Virtual Machine Manager site deployment for replication between on-premises sites](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image1.png)

### Virtual Machine Manager site deployment for replication between on-premises locations and Azure
When you set up database recovery between on-premises locations and Azure, you need to download the Azure Site Recovery provider and install it on the Virtual Machine Manager server. You also need to install the Azure Recovery Services Agent, which needs to be installed on each Hyper-V host. [Learn more](site-recovery-hyper-v-azure-architecture.md) for more information.

![Virtual Machine Manager site deployment for replication between on-premises locations and Azure](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image2.png)

### Hyper-V site deployment for replication between on-premises locations and Azure
This process is similar to Virtual Machine Manager deployment. The only difference is that the Azure Site Recovery provider and Azure Recovery Services Agent get installed on the Hyper-V host itself. [Learn more](site-recovery-hyper-v-azure-architecture.md). .

## Monitor configuration, protection, and recovery operations
Every operation in Azure Site Recovery is audited and tracked under the **JOBS** tab. For any configuration, protection, or recovery error, go to the **JOBS** tab and look for failures.

![The Failed filter in the JOBS tab](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image3.png)

If you find failures under the **JOBS** tab, click the job, and click **ERROR DETAILS** for that job.

![The ERROR DETAILS button](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image4.png)

The error details will help you identify a possible cause and recommendation for the issue.

![Dialog box that shows error details for a specific job](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image5.png)

In the previous example, another operation that is in progress seems to be causing the protection configuration to fail. Resolve the issue based on the recommendation, and then click **RESTART** to initiate the operation again.

![The RESTART button in the JOBS tab](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image6.png)

The **RESTART** option is not available for all operations. If an operation doesnâ€™t have the **RESTART** option, go back to the object and redo the operation again. You can cancel any job that's in-progress by using the **CANCEL** button.

![The CANCEL button](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image7.png)

## Monitor replication health for virtual machines
You can use the Azure portal to remotely monitor Azure Site Recovery providers for each of the protected entities. Click **PROTECTED ITEMS**, and then click **VMM CLOUDS** or **PROTECTION GROUPS**. The **VMM CLOUDS** tab is only available for deployments that are based on Virtual Machine Manager. For other scenarios, the protected entities are under the **PROTECTION GROUPS** tab.

![The VMM Clouds and PROTECTION GROUPS options](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image8.png)

Click a protected entity under the respective cloud or protection group to see all available operations are shown in the bottom pane.

![Available options for a selected protected entity](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image9.png)

As shown in the previous screenshot, the virtual machine health is **Critical**. You can click the **ERROR DETAILS** button on the bottom to see the error. Based on the **Possible causes** and **Recommendation**, resolve the issue.

![The Error Details button](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image10.png)

![Errors and recommendations in the Error Details dialog box](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image11.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If any active operations are in progress or failed, go to the **JOBS** view as mentioned earlier to view the error for a specific job.
>
>

## Troubleshoot on-premises Hyper-V issues
Connect to the on-premises Hyper-V manager console, select the virtual
machine, and see the replication health.

![Option to view replication health in the Hyper-V manager console](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image12.png)

In this case, **Replication Health** is **Critical**. Right-click the virtual machine, and then click **Replication** > **View Replication Health** to see the details.

![Replication health for a specific virtual machine](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image13.png)

If replication is paused for the virtual machine, right-click the virtual machine, and then click **Replication** > **Resume replication**.

![Option to resume replication in the Hyper-V manager console](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image19.png)

If a virtual machine migrates a new Hyper-V host that's within the cluster or a standalone machine and the Hyper-V host has been configured through Azure Site Recovery, replication for the virtual machine wouldn't be impacted. Ensure that the new Hyper-V host meets all the prerequisites and is configured by using Azure Site Recovery.

### Event Log

### Hyper-V replication logging options
All events that pertain to Hyper-V replication are logged in the Hyper-V-VMMS\\Admin log located under Applications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows. In addition, you can enable an Analytic log for the Hyper-V Virtual Machine Management Service. To enable this log, first make the Analytic and Debug logs viewable in the Event Viewer. Open Event Viewer, and then click **View** > **Show Analytic and Debug Logs**.

![The Show Analytic and Debug Logs option](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image14.png)

An Analytic log is visible under **Hyper-V-VMMS**.

![The Analytic log in the Event Viewer tree](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image15.png)

In the **Actions** pane, click **Enable Log**. After it's enabled, it
appears in **Performance Monitor** as an **Event Trace Session** located
under **Data Collector Sets.**

![Event Trace Sessions in the Performance Monitor tree](media/site-recovery-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/image16.png)

To view the collected information, first stop the tracing session by disabling the log. Save the log, and open it again in Event Viewer or use other tools to convert it as desired.

### Remote desktop troubleshooting after failover
* Many customers have faced issues to connect to the failed over virtual machine in Azure. [Use the troubleshooting document to RDP into the virtual machine](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31666.troubleshooting-remote-desktop-connection-after-failover-using-asr.aspx).

#### Adding a public IP on a resource manager virtual machine
If the **Connect** button in the portal is dimmed, and you are not connected to Azure via an Express Route or Site-to-Site VPN connection, you need to create and assign your virtual machine a public IP address before you can use Remote Desktop/Shared Shell. You can then add a Public IP on the network interface of the virtual machine.
