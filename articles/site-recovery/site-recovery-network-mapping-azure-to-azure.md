# Network mapping between two Azure regions


This article describes how to map Azure virtual networks of two Azure regions with each other. Network mapping ensures that when replicated virtual machine is created in the target Azure region, it is created on the virtual network that is mapped to virtual network of the source virtual machine.  

## Prerequisites
Before you map networks make sure, you have created [Azure virtual networks](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md) in both source and target Azure regions.

## Map networks

To map an Azure virtual network in one Azure region to another virtual network in another region, go to Site Recovery Infrastructure -> Network Mapping (For Azure Virtual Machines) and create a network mapping.

In the example below my virtual machine is running in East Asia region and is being replicated to Southeast Asia.

Select the source and target network and then click OK to create a network mapping from East Asia to Southeast Asia.

Do the same thing to create a network mapping from Southeast Asia to East Asia.

## Mapping network when enabling replication

If network mapping is not done when you are replicating a virtual machine for the first time from one Azure region to another, then you can choose target network as part of the same process. Site Recovery creates network mappings from source region to target region and from target region to source region based on this selection.   

![Network Mapping](./media/site-recovery-network-mapping-azure-to-azure/network-mapping4.png)

By default, Site Recovery creates a network in the target region that is identical to the source network and by adding '-asr' as a suffix to the name of the source network. You can choose an already created network by clicking Customize.

If the network mapping is already done, you can't change the target virtual network while enabling replication. To change it, modify existing network mapping.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you modify a network mapping from region-1 to region-2, make sure you modify the network mapping from region-2 to region-1 as well.

## Subnet selection
Subnet of the target virtual machine is selected based on the name of the subnet of the source virtual machine. If there is a subnet of the same name as that of the source virtual machine available in the target network, then that is chosen for the target virtual machine. If there is no subnet with the same name in the target network, then alphabetically first subnet is chosen as the target subnet. You can modify this subnet by going to Compute and Network settings of the virtual machine.

## IP address

IP address for each of the network interface of the target virtual machine is chosen as follows:

### DHCP
If the network interface of the source virtual machine is using DHCP, then the network interface of the target virtual machine is also set as DHCP.

### Static IP
If the network interface of the source virtual machine is using Static IP, then the network interface of the target virtual machine is also set to use Static IP. Static IP is chosen as follows:

#### Same address space

If the source subnet and the target subnet have the same address space, then the target IP is set same as the IP of  the network interface of the source virtual machine. If same IP is not available, then some other available IP is set as the target IP.

#### Different address space

If the source subnet and the target subnet have different address space, then the target IP is set as any available IP in the target subnet.

You can modify the target IP on each network interface by going to Compute and Network settings of the virtual machine.
