# Delete a Site Recovery vault
Dependencies can prevent you from deleting an Azure Site Recovery vault. The actions you need to take vary based on the Site Recovery scenario: VMware to Azure, Hyper-V (with and without System Center Virtual Machine Manager) to Azure, and Azure Backup. To delete a vault used in Azure Backup, see [Delete a Backup vault in Azure](../backup/backup-azure-delete-vault.md).



## Delete a Site Recovery vault 
To delete the vault, follow the recommended steps for your scenario.

### VMware VMs to Azure

1. Delete all protected VMs by following the steps in [Disable protection for a VMware](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md#disable-protection-for-a-vmware-vm-or-physical-server-vmware-to-azure).

2. Delete all replication policies by following the steps in [Delete a replication policy](site-recovery-setup-replication-settings-vmware.md##delete-a-replication-policy).

3. Delete references to vCenter by following the steps in [Delete a vCenter](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-manage-vCenter.md##delete-a-vcenter-in-azure-site-recovery).

4. Delete the configuration server by following the steps in [Decommission a configuration server](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-manage-configuration-server.md##delete-or-unregister-a-configuration-server).

5. Delete the vault.


### Hyper-V VMs (with Virtual Machine Manager) to Azure
1. Delete all protected VMs by following the steps in[Disable protection for a Hyper-V virtual machine replicating to Azure using the System Center VMM to Azure scenario](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md#disable-protection-for-a-hyper-v-virtual-machine-replicating-to-azure-using-the-system-center-vmm-to-azure-scenario).

2. Disassociate & delete all replication policies by browsing to your Vault -> **Site Recovery Infrastructure** - > **For System Center VMM** -> **Replication Policies**

3.	Delete references to Virtual Machine Manager servers by following the steps in [Unregister a connected VMM server](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md##unregister-a-vmm-server).

4.	Delete the vault.

### Hyper-V VMs (without Virtual Machine Manager) to Azure
1. Delete all protected VMs by following the steps in [Disable protection for a Hyper-V virtual machine (Hyper-V to Azure)](site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md#disable-protection-for-a-hyper-v-virtual-machine-hyper-v-to-azure).

2. Disassociate & delete all replication policies by browsing to your Vault -> **Site Recovery Infrastructure** - > **For Hyper-V Sites** -> **Replication Policies**

3. Delete references to Hyper-V servers by following the steps in [Unregister a Hyper-V host](/site-recovery-manage-registration-and-protection.md##unregister-a-hyper-v-host-in-a-hyper-v-site).

4. Delete the Hyper-V site.

5. Delete the vault.


## Use PowerShell to force delete the vault 

> [!Important]
> If you're testing the product and aren't concerned about data loss, use the force delete method to rapidly remove the vault and all its dependencies.
> The PowerShell command deletes all the contents of the vault and is **not reversible**.

To delete the Site Recovery vault even if there are protected items, use these commands:

    Login-AzureRmAccount

    Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "XXXXX"

    $vault = Get-AzureRmSiteRecoveryVault -Name "vaultname"

    Remove-AzureRmSiteRecoveryVault -Vault $vault
