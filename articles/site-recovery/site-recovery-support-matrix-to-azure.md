# Azure Site Recovery support matrix for replicating from on-premises to Azure


This article summarizes supported configurations and components for Azure Site Recovery when replicating and recovering to Azure. For more about Azure Site Recovery requirements, see the [prerequisites](site-recovery-prereq.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that you update to the latest version of Site Recovery provider and agent to achieve compatability with the updates in the support matrix.

## Supported file systems and guest storage configurations on Linux (VMware/Physical servers)

The following file systems and storage configuration software is supported on Linux servers running on VMware or Physical servers:
* File systems: ext3, ext4, ReiserFS (Suse Linux Enterprise Server only), XFS
* Volume manager : LVM2
* Multipath software : Device Mapper

Paravirtualized storage devices (devices exported by paravirtualized drivers) are not supported.<br/>
Multi-queue block IO devices are not supported.<br/>
Physical servers with the HP CCISS storage controller aren't supported.<br/>

>[!Note]
> On Linux servers the following directories (if set up as separate partitions/file-systems) must all be on the same disk (the OS disk) on the source server:   / (root), /boot, /usr, /usr/local, /var, /etc<br/><br/>
> XFSv5 features on XFS filesystems such as metadata checksum are supported starting from version 9.10 of the Mobility service. If you are using XFSv5 features, ensure you are running Mobility Service version 9.10 or later. You can use the xfs_info utility to check the XFS superblock for the partition. If ftype is set to 1, then XFSv5 features are being used.

## Failed-over Azure VM requirements

You can deploy Site Recovery to replicate virtual machines and physical servers running any operating system supported by Azure. This includes most versions of Windows and Linux. On-premises VMs that you want to replicate must conform with the following Azure requirements while replicating to Azure.

**Entity** | **Requirements** | **Details**
--- | --- | ---
**Guest operating system** | Hyper-V to Azure replication: Site Recovery supports all operating systems that are [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868%28v=ws.10%29.aspx). <br/><br/> For VMware and physical server replication: Check the Windows and Linux [prerequisites](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md) | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Guest operating system architecture** | 64-bit | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk size** | Up to 2048 GB if you are replicating **VMware VMs or physical servers to Azure**.<br/><br/>Upto 2048 GB for **Hyper-V Generation 1** VMs.<br/><br/>Upto 300 GB for **Hyper-V Generation 2 VMs**.  | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Operating system disk count** | 1 | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported.
**Data disk count** | 64 or less if you are replicating **VMware VMs to Azure**; 16 or less if you are replicating **Hyper-V VMs to Azure** | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Data disk VHD size** | Up to 4095 GB | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Network adapters** | Multiple adapters are supported |
**Shared VHD** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**FC disk** | Not supported | Prerequisites check will fail if unsupported
**Hard disk format** | VHD <br/><br/> VHDX | Although VHDX isn't currently supported in Azure, Site Recovery automatically converts VHDX to VHD when you fail over to Azure. When you fail back to on-premises the virtual machines continue to use the VHDX format.
**Bitlocker** | Not supported | Bitlocker must be disabled before protecting a virtual machine.
**VM name** | Between 1 and 63 characters. Restricted to letters, numbers, and hyphens. The VM name must start and end with a letter or number. | Update the value in the virtual machine properties in Site Recovery.
**VM type** | Generation 1<br/><br/> Generation 2 -- Windows | Generation 2 VMs with an OS disk type of basic (which includes one or two data volumes formatted as VHDX) and less than 300 GB of disk space are supported.<br></br>Linux Generation 2 VMs aren't supported.
