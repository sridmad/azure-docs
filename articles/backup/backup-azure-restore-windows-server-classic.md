This article explains how to recover data from a backup vault and restore it to a server or computer. Starting in March 2017, you can no longer create backup vaults in the classic portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can now upgrade your Backup vaults to Recovery Services vaults. For details, see the article [Upgrade a Backup vault to a Recovery Services vault](backup-azure-upgrade-backup-to-recovery-services.md). Microsoft encourages you to upgrade your Backup vaults to Recovery Services vaults.<br/> After **November 30, 2017**, you will not be able to use PowerShell to create Backup vaults. <br/> **Starting November 30, 2017**:
>- Any remaining Backup vaults will be automatically upgraded to Recovery Services vaults.
>- You won't be able to access your backup data in the classic portal. Instead, use the Azure portal to access your backup data in Recovery Services vaults.
>

To restore data, you use the Recover Data wizard in the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent. When you restore data, it is possible to:

* Restore data to the same machine from which the backups were taken.
* Restore data to an alternate machine.

In January 2017, Microsoft released a Preview update to the MARS agent. Along with bug fixes, this update enables Instant Restore, which allows you to mount a writeable recovery point snapshot as a recovery volume. You can then explore the recovery volume and copy files to a local computer thereby selectively restoring files.

> [!NOTE]
> The [January 2017 Azure Backup update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3216528?preview) is required if you want to use Instant Restore to restore data. Also the backup data must be protected in vaults in locales listed in the support article. Consult the [January 2017 Azure Backup update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3216528?preview) for the latest list of locales that support Instant Restore. Instant Restore is **not** currently available in all locales.
>

Instant Restore is available for use in Recovery Services vaults in the Azure portal and Backup vaults in the classic portal. If you want to use Instant Restore, download the MARS update, and follow the procedures that mention Instant Restore.


## Use Instant Restore to recover data to the same machine

If you accidentally deleted a file and wish to restore it to the same machine (from which the backup is taken), the following steps will help you recover the data.

1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup** snap in. If you don't know where the snap in was installed, search the computer or server for **Microsoft Azure Backup**.

    The desktop app should appear in the search results.

2. Click **Recover Data** to start the wizard.

    ![Recover Data](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/recover.png)

3. On the **Getting Started** pane, to restore the data to the same server or computer, select **This server (`<server name>`)** and click **Next**.

    ![Choose This server option to restore the data to the same machine](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_gettingstarted_instantrestore.png)

4. On the **Select Recovery Mode** pane, choose
**Individual files and folders** and then click **Next**.

    ![Browse files](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_selectrecoverymode_instantrestore.png)

5. On the **Select Volume and Date** pane, select the volume that contains the files and/or folders you want to restore.

    On the calendar, select a recovery point. You can restore from any recovery point in time. Dates in **bold** indicate the availability of at least one recovery point. Once you select a date, if multiple recovery points are available, choose the specific recovery point from the **Time** drop-down menu.

    ![Volume and Date](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_selectvolumedate_instantrestore.png)

6. Once you have chosen the recovery point to restore, click **Mount**.

    Azure Backup mounts the local recovery point, and uses it as a recovery volume.

7. On the **Browse and Recover Files** pane, click **Browse** to open Windows Explorer and find the files and folders you want.

    ![Recovery options](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_browserecover_instantrestore.png)


8. In Windows Explorer, copy the files and/or folders you want to restore and paste them to any location local to the server or computer. You can open or stream the files directly from the recovery volume and verify the correct versions are recovered.

    ![Copy and paste files and folders from mounted volume to local location](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_copy_instantrestore.png)

9. When you are finished restoring the files and/or folders, on the **Browse and Recovery Files** pane, click **Unmount**. Then click **Yes** to confirm that you want to unmount the volume.

    ![Unmount the volume and confirm](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/samemachine_unmount_instantrestore.png)

    > [!Important]
    > If you do not click Unmount, the Recovery Volume will remain mounted for six hours from the time when it was mounted. No backup operations will run while the volume is mounted. Any backup operation scheduled to run during the time when the volume is mounted, will run after the recovery volume is unmounted.

## Recover data to the same machine
If you accidentally deleted a file and wish to restore it to the same machine (from which the backup is taken), the following steps will help you recover the data.

1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup** snap in.
2. Click **Recover Data** to initiate the workflow.

    ![Recover Data](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/recover.png)
3. Select the **This server (*yourmachinename*)** option to restore the backed up file on the same machine.

    ![Same machine](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/samemachine.png)
4. Choose to **Browse for files** or **Search for files**.

    Leave the default option if you plan to restore one or more files whose path is known. If you are not sure about the folder structure but would like to search for a file, pick the **Search for files** option. For the purpose of this section, we will proceed with the default option.

    ![Browse files](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/browseandsearch.png)
5. Select the volume from which you wish to restore the file.

    You can restore from any point in time. Dates which appear in **bold** in the calendar control indicate the availability of a restore point. Once a date is selected, based on your backup schedule (and the success of a backup operation), you can select a point in time from the **Time** drop down.

    ![Volume and Date](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/volanddate.png)
6. Select the items to recover. You can multi-select folders/files you wish to restore.

    ![Select files](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/selectfiles.png)
7. Specify the recovery parameters.

    ![Recovery options](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/recoveroptions.png)

   * You have an option of restoring to the original location (in which the file/folder would be overwritten) or to another location in the same machine.
   * If the file/folder you wish to restore exists in the target location, you can create copies (two versions of the same file), overwrite the files in the target location, or skip the recovery of the files which exist in the target.
   * It is highly recommended that you leave the default option of restoring the ACLs on the files which are being recovered.
8. Once these inputs are provided, click **Next**. The recovery workflow, which restores the files to this machine, will begin.

## Recover to an alternate machine
If your entire server is lost, you can still recover data from Azure Backup to a different machine. The following steps illustrate the workflow.  

The terminology used in these steps includes:

* *Source machine* – The original machine from which the backup was taken and which is currently unavailable.
* *Target machine* – The machine to which the data is being recovered.
* *Sample vault* – The Backup vault to which the *Source machine* and *Target machine* are registered. <br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Backups taken from a machine cannot be restored on a machine which is running an earlier version of the operating system. For example, if backups are taken from a Windows 7 machine, it can be restored on a Windows 8 or above machine. However, the vice-versa does not hold true.
>
>

1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup** snap in on the *Target machine*.
2. Ensure that the *Target machine* and the *Source machine* are registered to the same backup vault.
3. Click **Recover Data** to initiate the workflow.

    ![Recover Data](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/recover.png)
4. Select **Another server**

    ![Another Server](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/anotherserver.png)
5. Provide the vault credential file that corresponds to the *Sample vault*. If the vault credential file is invalid (or expired) download a new vault credential file from the *Sample vault* in the Azure classic portal. Once the vault credential file is provided, the backup vault against the vault credential file is displayed.
6. Select the *Source machine* from the list of displayed machines.

    ![List of machines](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/machinelist.png)
7. Select either the **Search for files** or **Browse for files** option. For the purpose of this section, we will use the **Search for files** option.

    ![Search](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/search.png)
8. Select the volume and date in the next screen. Search for the folder/file name you want to restore.

    ![Search items](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/searchitems.png)
9. Select the location where the files need to be restored.

    ![Restore location](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/restorelocation.png)
10. Provide the encryption passphrase that was provided during *Source machine’s* registration to *Sample vault*.

    ![Encryption](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server-classic/encryption.png)
11. Once the input is provided, click **Recover**, which triggers the restore of the backed up files to the destination provided.

## Use Instant Restore to restore data to an alternate machine
If your entire server is lost, you can still recover data from Azure Backup to a different machine. The following steps illustrate the workflow.

The terminology used in these steps includes:

* *Source machine* – The original machine from which the backup was taken and which is currently unavailable.
* *Target machine* – The machine to which the data is being recovered.
* *Sample vault* – The Recovery Services vault to which the *Source machine* and *Target machine* are registered. <br/>

> [!NOTE]
> Backups can't be restored to a target machine running an earlier version of the operating system. For example, a backup taken from a Windows 7 computer can be restored on a Windows 8, or later, computer. A backup taken from a Windows 8 computer cannot be restored to a Windows 7 computer.

    ![Search](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/alternatemachine_selectrecoverymode_instantrestore.png)

8. On the **Select Volume and Date** pane, select the volume that contains the files and/or folders you want to restore.

    On the calendar, select a recovery point. You can restore from any recovery point in time. Dates in **bold** indicate the availability of at least one recovery point. Once you select a date, if multiple recovery points are available, choose the specific recovery point from the **Time** drop-down menu.

    ![Search items](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/alternatemachine_selectvolumedate_instantrestore.png)

9. Click **Mount** to locally mount the recovery point as a recovery volume on your *Target machine*.

10. On the **Browse and Recover Files** pane, click **Browse** to open Windows Explorer and find the files and folders you want.

    ![Encryption](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/alternatemachine_browserecover_instantrestore.png)

11. In Windows Explorer, copy the files and/or folders from the recovery volume and paste them to your *Target machine* location. You can open or stream the files directly from the recovery volume and verify the correct versions are recovered.

    ![Encryption](./media/backup-azure-restore-windows-server/alternatemachine_copy_instantrestore.png)

12. When you are finished restoring the files and/or folders, on the **Browse and Recovery Files** pane, click **Unmount**. Then click **Yes** to confirm that you want to unmount the volume.
