# Working with virtual network gateway SKUs (legacy SKUs)

This article contains information about the legacy (old) virtual network gateway SKUs. The legacy SKUs still work in both deployment models for VPN gateways that have already been created. Classic VPN gateways continue to use the legacy SKUs, both for existing gateways, and for new gateways. When creating new Resource Manager VPN gateways, use the new gateway SKUs. For information about the new SKUs, see [About VPN Gateway](vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md).

## <a name="gwsku"></a>Gateway SKUs

[!INCLUDE [Legacy gateway SKUs](../../includes/vpn-gateway-gwsku-legacy-include.md)]

## <a name="agg"></a>Estimated aggregate throughput by SKU

[!INCLUDE [Aggregated throughput by legacy SKU](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-gwtype-legacy-aggtput-include.md)]

## <a name="config"></a>Supported configurations by SKU and VPN type

[!INCLUDE [Table requirements for old SKUs](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-requirements-legacy-sku-include.md)]

## <a name="resize"></a>Resize a gateway (change a gateway SKU)

You can resize a gateway SKU within the same SKU family. For example, if you have a Standard SKU, you can resize to a HighPerformance SKU. You can't resize your VPN gateways between the old SKUs and the new SKU families. For example, you can't go from a Standard SKU to a VpnGw2 SKU.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When you resize a gateway, you will have 20-30 minutes of downtime for that gateway while it is being resized.

To resize a gateway SKU for the classic deployment model, use the following command:

```powershell
Resize-AzureVirtualNetworkGateway -GatewayId <Gateway ID> -GatewaySKU HighPerformance
```

To resize a gateway SKU for the Resource Manager deployment model, use the following command:

```powershell
$gw = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg
Resize-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -VirtualNetworkGateway $gw -GatewaySku HighPerformance
```

## <a name="migrate"></a>Migrate to the new gateway SKUs

If you are working with the Resource Manager deployment model, you can migrate to the new gateway SKUS. If you are working with the classic deployment model, you can't migrate to the new SKUs and must instead continue to use the legacy SKUs.
