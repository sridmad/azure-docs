# Azure Policy definition structure

Resource policy definition used by Azure Policy enables you to establish conventions for resources in your organization by describing when the policy is enforced and what action to take. By defining conventions, you can control costs and more easily manage your resources. For example, you can specify that only certain types of virtual machines are allowed. Or, you can require that all resources have a particular tag. Policies are inherited by all child resources. So, if a policy is applied to a resource group, it is applicable to all the resources in that resource group.

You use JSON to create a policy definition. The policy definition contains elements for:

* mode
* parameters
* display name
* description
* policy rule
  * logical evaluation
  * effect

For example, the following JSON shows a policy that limits where resources are deployed:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "mode": "all",
    "parameters": {
      "allowedLocations": {
        "type": "array",
        "metadata": {
          "description": "The list of locations that can be specified when deploying resources",
          "strongType": "location",
          "displayName": "Allowed locations"
        }
      }
    },
    "displayName": "Allowed locations",
    "description": "This policy enables you to restrict the locations your organization can specify when deploying resources.",
    "policyRule": {
      "if": {
        "not": {
          "field": "location",
          "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
        }
      },
      "then": {
        "effect": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All Azure Policy template samples are at [Templates for Azure Policy](json-samples.md).

## Mode

We recommend that you set `mode` to `all` to have a policy assignment evaluate all resource groups and types. You can see an example of a policy definition that enforces tags on a resource group at [Allow custom VM image from a Resource Group](scripts/allow-custom-vm-image.md).

When you set it to **all**, resource groups and all resource types are evaluated for the policy. The portal uses **all** for all policies. If you use PowerShell or Azure CLI, you need to specify the `mode` parameter and set it to **all**.

All policy definitions created using the portal use an `all` mode, however if you want to use PowerShell or Azure CLI, you need to specify the `mode` parameter and set it to `all`.

If you set mode to `indexed`, the policy assignment will be evaluated only on resource types that support tags and location.


## Parameters

Parameters help simplify your policy management by reducing the number of policy definitions. Think of parameters like the fields on a form â€“ `name`, `address`, `city`, `state`. These parameters always stay the same, however their values change based on the individual filling out the form. Parameters work the same way when building policies. By including parameters in a policy definition, you can reuse that policy for different scenarios by using different values.

For example, you could define a policy for a resource property to limit the locations where resources can be deployed. In this case, you would declare the following parameters when you create your policy:


```json
"parameters": {
  "allowedLocations": {
    "type": "array",
    "metadata": {
      "description": "The list of allowed locations for resources.",
      "displayName": "Allowed locations"
    }
  }
}
```

The type of a parameter can be either string or array. The metadata property is used for tools like the Azure portal to display user-friendly information.

In the policy rule, you reference parameters with the following syntax:

```json
{
    "field": "location",
    "in": "[parameters('allowedLocations')]"
}
```

## Display name and description

You can use **displayName** and **description** to identify the policy definition, and provide context for when it is used.

## Policy rule

The policy rule consists of **If** and **Then** blocks. In the **If** block, you define one or more conditions that specify when the policy is enforced. You can apply logical operators to these conditions to precisely define the scenario for a policy.

In the **Then** block, you define the effect that happens when the **If** conditions are fulfilled.

```json
{
  "if": {
    <condition> | <logical operator>
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny | audit | append"
  }
}
```

### Logical operators

Supported logical operators are:

* `"not": {condition  or operator}`
* `"allOf": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`
* `"anyOf": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`

The **not** syntax inverts the result of the condition. The **allOf** syntax (similar to the logical **And** operation) requires all conditions to be true. The **anyOf** syntax (similar to the logical **Or** operation) requires one or more conditions to be true.

You can nest logical operators. The following example shows a **not** operation that is nested within an **allOf** operation.

```json
"if": {
  "allOf": [
    {
      "not": {
        "field": "tags",
        "containsKey": "application"
      }
    },
    {
      "field": "type",
      "equals": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts"
    }
  ]
},
```

### Conditions

A condition evaluates whether a **field** meets certain criteria. The supported conditions are:

* `"equals": "value"`
* `"like": "value"`
* `"match": "value"`
* `"contains": "value"`
* `"in": ["value1","value2"]`
* `"containsKey": "keyName"`
* `"exists": "bool"`

When using the **like** condition, you can provide a wildcard (*) in the value.

When using the **match** condition, provide `#` to represent a digit, `?` for a letter, and any other character to represent that actual character. For examples, see [Approved VM images](scripts/allowed-custom-images.md).

### Fields
Conditions are formed by using fields. A field represents properties in the resource request payload that is used to describe the state of the resource.  

The following fields are supported:

* `name`
* `kind`
* `type`
* `location`
* `tags`
* `tags.*`
* property aliases - for a list, see [Aliases](#aliases).

### Effect
Policy supports the following types of effect:

* **Deny**: generates an event in the audit log and fails the request
* **Audit**: generates a warning event in audit log but does not fail the request
* **Append**: adds the defined set of fields to the request
* **AuditIfNotExists**: enables auditing if a resource does not exist
* **DeployIfNotExists**: deploys a resource if it does not already exist. Currently, this effect is only supported through built-in policies.
* **DenyIfNotExists**: denies the creation of an exist if it does not exist

For **append**, you must provide the following details:

```json
"effect": "append",
"details": [
  {
    "field": "field name",
    "value": "value of the field"
  }
]
```

The value can be either a string or a JSON format object.

With **AuditIfNotExists**, **DeployIfNotExists**, and **DenyIfNotExists**, you can evaluate the existence of a child resource and apply a rule and a corresponding effect when that resource does not exist. For example, you can require that a network watcher is deployed for all virtual networks
.
For an example of auditing when a virtual machine extension is not deployed, see [Audit if extension does not exist](scripts/audit-ext-not-exist.md).


## Aliases

You use property aliases to access specific properties for a resource type. Aliases enable you to restrict what values or conditions are permitted for a property on a resource. Each alias maps to paths in different API versions for a given resource type. During policy evaluation, the policy engine gets the property path for that API version.

## Initiatives

Initiatives enable you group several related policy definitions to simplify assignments and management because you work with a group as a single item. For example, you can group all related tagging policy definitions in a single initiative. Rather than assigning each policy individually, you apply the initiative.

The following example illustrates how to create an initiative for handling two tags: `costCenter` and `productName`. It uses two built-in policies to apply the default tag value.


```json
{
    "properties": {
        "displayName": "Billing Tags Policy",
        "policyType": "Custom",
        "description": "Specify cost Center tag and product name tag",
        "parameters": {
            "costCenterValue": {
                "type": "String",
                "metadata": {
                    "description": "required value for Cost Center tag"
                }
            },
            "productNameValue": {
                "type": "String",
                "metadata": {
                    "description": "required value for product Name tag"
                }
            }
        },
        "policyDefinitions": [
            {

                    }
                }
            },
            {
                "policyDefinitionId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/1e30110a-5ceb-460c-a204-c1c3969c6d62",

            },
