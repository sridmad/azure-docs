# How to use Azure IoT Hub

You have various options to learn how to develop for the IoT Hub service:

* Read the conceptual articles that describe the features of IoT Hub in detail.
* Follow one of the tutorials that cover the various features of IoT Hub.

## Developer guide

As a developer, you can read detailed conceptual guidance about IoT Hub in the [Developer Guide][lnk-devguide]. This guide includes:

* Detailed descriptions of all the IoT Hub features to help you to learn how to use them.
* Guidance on how to choose when multiple options are available.

## Tutorials

If you prefer to learn about specific IoT Hub features by working through hands-on exercises, there are several tutorials to choose from. Many of these tutorials are available in multiple programming languages. These tutorials include:

- [Process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages using routes][lnk-routes-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use IoT Hub routing rules to dispatch device-to-cloud messages in an easy, configuration-based way.

- [Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub][lnk-c2d-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to send cloud-to-device messages through IoT Hub and receive cloud-to-device messages on a device.

- [Upload files from devices to the cloud with IoT Hub][lnk-upload-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use the file upload capabilities of IoT Hub.

- [Get started with device twins][lnk-twin-tutorial]. This tutorial introduces you to device twins, reported properties, desired properties, and tags. You use device twins to synchronize values with your devices.

- [Use direct methods][lnk-methods-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use direct methods. You add a handler for a direct method in your simulated device and invoke the direct method from IoT Hub.

- [Get started with device management][lnk-dm-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use key device management features such as twins and direct methods. You use these features to remotely reboot your simulated device.

- [Use desired properties to configure devices][lnk-properties-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use the device twin's desired and reported properties, to remotely configure your device.

- [Use device jobs to initiate a device firmware update][lnk-jobs-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use key device management features such as twins and direct methods. You learn how to use these features to remotely update your device's firmware.

- [Schedule and broadcast jobs][lnk-schedule-tutorial]. This tutorial shows you how to use desired properties and direct methods to interact with multiple devices at a scheduled time.
