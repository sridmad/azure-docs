# Reference - IoT Hub quotas and throttling

## Quotas and throttling
Each Azure subscription can have at most 10 IoT hubs, and at most 1 Free hub.

Each IoT hub is provisioned with a certain number of units in a specific SKU (for more information, see [Azure IoT Hub Pricing][lnk-pricing]). The SKU and number of units determine the maximum daily quota of messages that you can send.

The SKU also determines the throttling limits that IoT Hub enforces on all operations.

## Operation throttles
Operation throttles are rate limitations that are applied in the minute ranges, and are intended to avoid abuse. IoT Hub tries to avoid returning errors whenever possible, but it starts returning exceptions if the throttle is violated for too long.

The following table shows the enforced throttles. Values refer to an individual hub.

| Throttle | Free and S1 hubs | S2 hubs | S3 hubs | 
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Identity registry operations (create, retrieve, list, update, delete) | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 83.33/sec/unit (5000/min/unit) |
| Device connections | Higher of 100/sec or 12/sec/unit <br/> For example, two S1 units are 2\*12 = 24/sec, but you have at least 100/sec across your units. With nine S1 units, you have 108/sec (9\*12) across your units. | 120/sec/unit | 6000/sec/unit |
| Device-to-cloud sends | Higher of 100/sec or 12/sec/unit <br/> For example, two S1 units are 2\*12 = 24/sec, but you have at least 100/sec across your units. With nine S1 units, you have 108/sec (9\*12) across your units. | 120/sec/unit | 6000/sec/unit |
| Cloud-to-device sends | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 83.33/sec/unit (5000/min/unit) |
| Cloud-to-device receives <br/> (only when device uses HTTPS)| 16.67/sec/unit (1000/min/unit) | 16.67/sec/unit (1000/min/unit) | 833.33/sec/unit (50000/min/unit) |
| File upload | 1.67 file upload notifications/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 1.67 file upload notifications/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 83.33 file upload notifications/sec/unit (5000/min/unit) |
| Direct methods | 20/sec/unit | 60/sec/unit | 3000/sec/unit | 
| Device twin reads | 10/sec | Higher of 10/sec or 1/sec/unit | 50/sec/unit |
| Device twin updates | 10/sec | Higher of 10/sec or 1/sec/unit | 50/sec/unit |
| Jobs operations <br/> (create, update, list, delete) | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 1.67/sec/unit (100/min/unit) | 83.33/sec/unit (5000/min/unit) |
| Jobs per-device operation throughput | 10/sec | Higher of 10/sec or 1/sec/unit | 50/sec/unit |

It is important to clarify that the *device connections* throttle governs the rate at which new device connections can be established with an IoT hub. The *device connections* throttle does not govern the maximum number of simultaneously connected devices. The throttle depends on the number of units that are provisioned for the IoT hub.

For example, if you buy a single S1 unit, you get a throttle of 100 connections per second. Therefore, to connect 100,000 devices, it takes at least 1000 seconds (approximately 16 minutes). However, you can have as many simultaneously connected devices as you have devices registered in your identity registry.

For an in-depth discussion of IoT Hub throttling behavior, see the blog post [IoT Hub throttling and you][lnk-throttle-blog].

> [!NOTE]
> At any given time, it is possible to increase quotas or throttle limits by increasing the number of provisioned units in an IoT hub.
> 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Identity registry operations are intended for run-time use in device management and provisioning scenarios. Reading or updating a large number of device identities is supported through [import and export jobs][lnk-importexport].

## Other limits

IoT Hub enforces other operational limits:

| Operation | Limit |
| --------- | ----- |
| File upload URIs | 10000 SAS URIs can be out for a storage account at one time. <br/> 10 SAS URIs/device can be out at one time. |
| Jobs | Job history is retained up to 30 days <br/> Maximum concurrent jobs is 1 (for Free) and S1, 5 (for S2), 10 (for S3). |
| Additional endpoints | Paid SKU hubs may have 10 additional endpoints. Free SKU hubs may have one additional endpoint. |
| Message routing rules | Paid SKU hubs may have 100 routing rules. Free SKU hubs may have five routing rules. |
| Device-to-cloud messaging | Maximum message size 256 KB |
| Cloud-to-device messaging | Maximum message size 64 KB |
| Cloud-to-device messaging | Maximum pending messages for delivery is 50 |

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the maximum number of devices you can connect to a single IoT hub is 500,000. If you want to increase this limit, contact [Microsoft Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).

## Latency
IoT Hub strives to provide low latency for all operations. However, due to network conditions and other unpredictable factors it cannot guarantee a maximum latency. When designing your solution, you should:

* Avoid making any assumptions about the maximum latency of any IoT Hub operation.
* Provision your IoT hub in the Azure region closest to your devices.
* Consider using Azure IoT Edge to perform latency-sensitive operations on the device or on a gateway close to the device.

Multiple IoT Hub units affect throttling as described previously, but do not provide any additional latency benefits or guarantees.
If you see unexpected increases in operation latency, contact [Microsoft Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).
