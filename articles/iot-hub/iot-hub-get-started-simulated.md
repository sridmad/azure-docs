# Azure IoT Hub get started with simulated devices tutorials

These tutorials introduce you to Azure IoT Hub and the device SDKs. The tutorials cover common IoT scenarios to demonstrate the capabilities of IoT Hub. The tutorials also illustrate how to combine IoT Hub with other Azure services and tools to build more powerful IoT solutions. The tutorials listed in the following table show you how to create simulated IoT devices.

| Programming language |
