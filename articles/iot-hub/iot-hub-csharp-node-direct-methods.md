# Use direct methods (.NET/Node)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-c2d-methods](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-c2d-methods.md)]

In this tutorial, we are going to develop a .NET and a Node.js console app:

* **CallMethodOnDevice.sln**, a .NET back-end app, which calls a method in the simulated device app and displays the response.
* **SimulatedDevice.js**, a Node.js app, which simulates a device connecting to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and responds to the method called by the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both applications to run on devices and your solution back end.
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* Node.js version 4.0.x or later.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create a simulated device app
In this section, you create a Node.js console app that responds to a method called by the solution back end.

1. Create a new empty folder called **simulateddevice**. In the **simulateddevice** folder, create a package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
2. At your command prompt in the **simulateddevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device** and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** packages:
   
    ```
        npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
    ```
3. Using a text editor, create a file in the **simulateddevice** folder and name it **SimulatedDevice.js**.
4. Add the following `require` statements at the start of the **SimulatedDevice.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var Mqtt = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
    var DeviceClient = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
    ```
5. Add a **connectionString** variable and use it to create a **DeviceClient** instance. Replace **{device connection string}** with the device connection string you generated in the *Create a device identity* section:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = '{device connection string}';
    var client = DeviceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Mqtt);
    ```
6. Add the following function to implement the direct method on the device:
   
    ```
    function onWriteLine(request, response) {
        console.log(request.payload);
   
        response.send(200, 'Input was written to log.', function(err) {
            if(err) {
                console.error('An error occurred when sending a method response:\n' + err.toString());
            } else {
                console.log('Response to method \'' + request.methodName + '\' sent successfully.' );
            }
        });
    }
    ```
7. Open the connection to your IoT hub and initialize the method listener:
   
    ```
    client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('could not open IotHub client');
        }  else {
            console.log('client opened');
            client.onDeviceMethod('writeLine', onWriteLine);
        }
    });
    ```
8. Save and close the **SimulatedDevice.js** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as connection retry), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling][lnk-transient-faults].

## Call a direct method on a device
In this section, you create a .NET console app that calls a method in the simulated device app and then displays the response.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution by using the **Console Application** project template. Make sure the .NET Framework version is 4.5.1 or later. Name the project **CallMethodOnDevice**.
   
    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][10]
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **CallMethodOnDevice** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages...**.
3. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse**, search for **microsoft.azure.devices**, select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK][lnk-nuget-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.
   
    ![NuGet Package Manager window][11]

4. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using System.Threading.Tasks;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub that you created in the previous section.
   
        static ServiceClient serviceClient;
        static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
6. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        private static async Task InvokeMethod()
        {
            var methodInvocation = new CloudToDeviceMethod("writeLine") { ResponseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30) };
            methodInvocation.SetPayloadJson("'a line to be written'");

            var response = await serviceClient.InvokeDeviceMethodAsync("myDeviceId", methodInvocation);

            Console.WriteLine("Response status: {0}, payload:", response.Status);
            Console.WriteLine(response.GetPayloadAsJson());
        }
   
    This method invokes a direct method with name `writeLine` on the `myDeviceId` device. Then, it writes the response provided by the device on the console. Note how it is possible to specify a timeout value for the device to respond.
7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        InvokeMethod().Wait();
        Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit.");
        Console.ReadLine();

## Run the applications
You are now ready to run the applications.

1. In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click your solution, and then click **Set StartUp Projects...**. Select **Single startup project**, and then select the **CallMethodOnDevice** project in the dropdown menu.

2. At a command prompt in the **simulateddevice** folder, run the following command to start listening for method calls from your IoT Hub:
   
    ```
    node SimulatedDevice.js
    ```
   Wait for the simulated device to open:
    ![][7]
3. Now that the device is connected and waiting for method invocations, run the .NET **CallMethodOnDevice** app to invoke the method in the simulated device app. You should see the device response written in the console.
   
    ![][8]
4. The device then reacts to the method by printing this message:
   
    ![][9]

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the simulated device app to react to methods invoked by the cloud. You also created an app that invokes methods on the device and displays the response from the device.
