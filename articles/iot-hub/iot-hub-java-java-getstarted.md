# Connect your device to your IoT hub using Java
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you have three Java console apps:

* **create-device-identity**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your device app.
* **read-d2c-messages**, which displays the telemetry sent by your device app.
* **simulated-device**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second using the MQTT protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both apps to run on devices and your solution back end.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* The latest [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
* [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

As a final step, make a note of the **Primary key** value. Then click **Endpoints** and the **Events** built-in endpoint. On the **Properties** blade, make a note of the **Event Hub-compatible name** and the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint** address. You need these three values when you create your **read-d2c-messages** app.

![Azure portal IoT Hub Messaging blade][6]

You have now created your IoT hub. You have the IoT Hub host name, IoT Hub connection string, IoT Hub Primary Key, Event Hub-compatible name, and Event Hub-compatible endpoint you need to complete this tutorial.

## Create a device identity
In this section, you create a Java console app that creates a device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the identity registry. For more information, see the **Identity Registry** section of the [IoT Hub developer guide][lnk-devguide-identity]. When you run this console app, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can use to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

1. Create an empty folder called iot-java-get-started. In the iot-java-get-started folder, create a Maven project called **create-device-identity** using the following command at your command prompt. Note this is a single, long command:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=create-device-identity -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```

2. At your command prompt, navigate to the create-device-identity folder.

3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the create-device-identity folder and add the following dependency to the **dependencies** node. This dependency enables you to use the iot-service-client package in your app:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot</groupId>
      <artifactId>iot-service-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.7.23</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can check for the latest version of **iot-service-client** using [Maven search][lnk-maven-service-search].

4. Save and close the pom.xml file.

5. Using a text editor, open the create-device-identity\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.

6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:

    ```java
    import com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.service.exceptions.IotHubException;
    import com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.service.Device;
    import com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.service.RegistryManager;
   
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.URISyntaxException;
    ```

7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class, replacing **{yourhubconnectionstring}** with the value your noted earlier:

    ```java
    private static final String connectionString = "{yourhubconnectionstring}";
    private static final String deviceId = "myFirstJavaDevice";
    ```
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-pii-note-naming-device](../../includes/iot-hub-pii-note-naming-device.md)]

8. Modify the signature of the **main** method to include the exceptions as follows:

    ```java
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, URISyntaxException, Exception
    ```

9. Add the following code as the body of the **main** method. This code creates a device called *javadevice* in your IoT Hub identity registry if doesn't already exist. It then displays the device ID and key that you need later:

    ```java
    RegistryManager registryManager = RegistryManager.createFromConnectionString(connectionString);

    // Create a device that's enabled by default, 
    // with an autogenerated key.
    Device device = Device.createFromId(deviceId, null, null);
    try {
      device = registryManager.addDevice(device);
    } catch (IotHubException iote) {
      // If the device already exists.
      try {
        device = registryManager.getDevice(deviceId);
      } catch (IotHubException iotf) {
        iotf.printStackTrace();
      }
    }

    // Display information about the
    // device you created.
    System.out.println("Device Id: " + device.getDeviceId());
    System.out.println("Device key: " + device.getPrimaryKey());
    ```

10. Save and close the App.java file.

11. To build the **create-device-identity** app using Maven, execute the following command at the command prompt in the create-device-identity folder:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

12. To run the **create-device-identity** app using Maven, execute the following command at the command prompt in the create-device-identity folder:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
    ```

13. Make a note of the **Device ID** and **Device key**. You need these values later when you create an app that connects to IoT Hub as a device.

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the IoT hub. It stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials and an enabled/disabled flag that you can use to disable access for an individual device. If your app needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an app-specific store. For more information, see the [IoT Hub developer guide][lnk-devguide-identity].

## Receive device-to-cloud messages

In this section, you create a Java console app that reads device-to-cloud messages from IoT Hub. An IoT hub exposes an [Event Hub][lnk-event-hubs-overview]-compatible endpoint to enable you to read device-to-cloud messages. To keep things simple, this tutorial creates a basic reader that is not suitable for a high throughput deployment. The [Process device-to-cloud messages][lnk-process-d2c-tutorial] tutorial shows you how to process device-to-cloud messages at scale. The [Get Started with Event Hubs][lnk-eventhubs-tutorial] tutorial provides further information on how to process messages from Event Hubs and is applicable to the IoT Hub Event Hub-compatible endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> The Event Hub-compatible endpoint for reading device-to-cloud messages always uses the AMQP protocol.

1. In the iot-java-get-started folder you created in the *Create a device identity* section, create a Maven project called **read-d2c-messages** using the following command at your command prompt. Note this is a single, long command:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=read-d2c-messages -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```

2. At your command prompt, navigate to the read-d2c-messages folder.

3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the read-d2c-messages folder and add the following dependency to the **dependencies** node. This dependency enables you to use the eventhubs-client package in your app to read from the Event Hub-compatible endpoint:

    ```xml
    <dependency> 
        <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId> 
        <artifactId>azure-eventhubs</artifactId> 
        <version>0.15.0</version> 
    </dependency>
    ```

4. Save and close the pom.xml file.

5. Using a text editor, open the read-d2c-messages\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.

6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:

    ```java
    import java.io.IOException;
    import com.microsoft.azure.eventhubs.*;

    import java.nio.charset.Charset;
    import java.time.*;
    import java.util.function.*;
    ```

7. Add the following class-level variable to the **App** class. Replace **{youriothubkey}**, **{youreventhubcompatibleendpoint}**, and **{youreventhubcompatiblename}** with the values you noted previously:

    ```java
    private static String connStr = "Endpoint={youreventhubcompatibleendpoint};EntityPath={youreventhubcompatiblename};SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey={youriothubkey}";
    ```

8. Add the following **receiveMessages** method to the **App** class. This method creates an **EventHubClient** instance to connect to the Event Hub-compatible endpoint and then asynchronously creates a **PartitionReceiver** instance to read from an Event Hub partition. It loops continuously and prints the message details until the app terminates.

    ```java
    // Create a receiver on a partition.
    private static EventHubClient receiveMessages(final String partitionId) {
      EventHubClient client = null;
      try {
        client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionStringSync(connStr);
      } catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Failed to create client: " + e.getMessage());
        System.exit(1);
      }
      try {
        // Create a receiver using the
        // default Event Hubs consumer group
        // that listens for messages from now on.
        client.createReceiver(EventHubClient.DEFAULT_CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME, partitionId, Instant.now())
          .thenAccept(new Consumer<PartitionReceiver>() {
            public void accept(PartitionReceiver receiver) {
              System.out.println("** Created receiver on partition " + partitionId);
              try {
                while (true) {
                  Iterable<EventData> receivedEvents = receiver.receive(100).get();
                  int batchSize = 0;
                  if (receivedEvents != null) {
                    System.out.println("Got some evenst");
                    for (EventData receivedEvent : receivedEvents) {
                      System.out.println(String.format("Offset: %s, SeqNo: %s, EnqueueTime: %s",
                        receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getOffset(),
                        receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getSequenceNumber(),
                        receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getEnqueuedTime()));
                      System.out.println(String.format("| Device ID: %s",
                        receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().get("iothub-connection-device-id")));
                      System.out.println(String.format("| Message Payload: %s",
                        new String(receivedEvent.getBytes(), Charset.defaultCharset())));
                      batchSize++;
                    }
                  }
                  System.out.println(String.format("Partition: %s, ReceivedBatch Size: %s", partitionId, batchSize));
                }
              } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Failed to receive messages: " + e.getMessage());
              }
            }
          });
        } catch (Exception e) {
          System.out.println("Failed to create receiver: " + e.getMessage());
      }
      return client;
    }
    ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This method uses a filter when it creates the receiver so that the receiver only reads messages sent to IoT Hub after the receiver starts running. This technique is useful in a test environment so you can see the current set of messages. In a production environment, your code should make sure that it processes all the messages - for more information, see the [How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages][lnk-process-d2c-tutorial] tutorial.

9. Modify the signature of the **main** method to include the exception as follows:

    ```java
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    ```

10. Add the following code to the **main** method in the **App** class. This code creates the two **EventHubClient** and **PartitionReceiver** instances and enables you to close the app when you have finished processing messages:

    ```java
    // Create receivers for partitions 0 and 1.
    EventHubClient client0 = receiveMessages("0");
    EventHubClient client1 = receiveMessages("1");
    System.out.println("Press ENTER to exit.");
    System.in.read();
    try {
      client0.closeSync();
      client1.closeSync();
      System.exit(0);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.exit(1);
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This code assumes you created your IoT hub in the F1 (free) tier. A free IoT hub has two partitions named "0" and "1".

11. Save and close the App.java file.

12. To build the **read-d2c-messages** app using Maven, execute the following command at the command prompt in the read-d2c-messages folder:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

## Create a device app
In this section, you create a Java console app that simulates a device that sends device-to-cloud messages to an IoT hub.

1. In the iot-java-get-started folder you created in the *Create a device identity* section, create a Maven project called **simulated-device** using the following command at your command prompt. Note this is a single, long command:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=simulated-device -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```

2. At your command prompt, navigate to the simulated-device folder.

3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the simulated-device folder and add the following dependencies to the **dependencies** node. This dependency enables you to use the iothub-java-client package in your app to communicate with your IoT hub and to serialize Java objects to JSON:

    ```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot</groupId>
      <artifactId>iot-device-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.32</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
      <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can check for the latest version of **iot-device-client** using [Maven search][lnk-maven-device-search].

4. Save and close the pom.xml file.

5. Using a text editor, open the simulated-device\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.

6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:

    ```java
    import com.microsoft.azure.sdk.iot.device.*;
    import com.google.gson.Gson;

    import java.io.*;
    import java.net.URISyntaxException;
    import java.util.Random;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    ```

7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class. Replacing **{youriothubname}** with your IoT hub name, and **{yourdevicekey}** with the device key value you generated in the *Create a device identity* section:

    ```java
    private static String connString = "HostName={youriothubname}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=myFirstJavaDevice;SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}";
    private static IotHubClientProtocol protocol = IotHubClientProtocol.MQTT;
    private static String deviceId = "myFirstJavaDevice";
    private static DeviceClient client;
    ```
   
    This sample app uses the **protocol** variable when it instantiates a **DeviceClient** object. You can use either the MQTT, AMQP, or HTTPS protocol to communicate with IoT Hub.

8. Add the following nested **TelemetryDataPoint** class inside the **App** class to specify the telemetry data your device sends to your IoT hub:

    ```java
    private static class TelemetryDataPoint {
      public String deviceId;
      public double temperature;
      public double humidity;
   
      public String serialize() {
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        return gson.toJson(this);
      }
    }
    ```
9. Add the following nested **EventCallback** class inside the **App** class to display the acknowledgement status that the IoT hub returns when it processes a message from the device app. This method also notifies the main thread in the app when the message has been processed:
   
    ```java
    private static class EventCallback implements IotHubEventCallback {
      public void execute(IotHubStatusCode status, Object context) {
        System.out.println("IoT Hub responded to message with status: " + status.name());
   
        if (context != null) {
          synchronized (context) {
            context.notify();
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

10. Add the following nested **MessageSender** class inside the **App** class. The **run** method in this class generates sample telemetry data to send to your IoT hub and waits for an acknowledgement before sending the next message:

    ```java
    private static class MessageSender implements Runnable {
      public void run()  {
        try {
          double minTemperature = 20;
          double minHumidity = 60;
          Random rand = new Random();
    
          while (true) {
            double currentTemperature = minTemperature + rand.nextDouble() * 15;
            double currentHumidity = minHumidity + rand.nextDouble() * 20;
            TelemetryDataPoint telemetryDataPoint = new TelemetryDataPoint();
            telemetryDataPoint.deviceId = deviceId;
            telemetryDataPoint.temperature = currentTemperature;
            telemetryDataPoint.humidity = currentHumidity;
    
            String msgStr = telemetryDataPoint.serialize();
            Message msg = new Message(msgStr);
            msg.setProperty("temperatureAlert", (currentTemperature > 30) ? "true" : "false");
            msg.setMessageId(java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString()); 
            System.out.println("Sending: " + msgStr);
    
            Object lockobj = new Object();
            EventCallback callback = new EventCallback();
            client.sendEventAsync(msg, callback, lockobj);
    
            synchronized (lockobj) {
              lockobj.wait();
            }
            Thread.sleep(1000);
          }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          System.out.println("Finished.");
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    This method sends a new device-to-cloud message one second after the IoT hub acknowledges the previous message. The message contains a JSON-serialized object with the deviceId and randomly generated numbers to simulate a temperature sensor, and a humidity sensor.

11. Replace the **main** method with the following code that creates a thread to send device-to-cloud messages to your IoT hub:

    ```java
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
      client = new DeviceClient(connString, protocol);
      client.open();
    
      MessageSender sender = new MessageSender();
    
      ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
      executor.execute(sender);
    
      System.out.println("Press ENTER to exit.");
      System.in.read();
      executor.shutdownNow();
      client.closeNow();
    }
    ```

12. Save and close the App.java file.

13. To build the **simulated-device** app using Maven, execute the following command at the command prompt in the simulated-device folder:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling][lnk-transient-faults].

## Run the apps

You are now ready to run the apps.

1. At a command prompt in the read-d2c folder, run the following command to begin monitoring the first partition in your IoT hub:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
    ```

    ![Java IoT Hub service app to monitor device-to-cloud messages][7]

2. At a command prompt in the simulated-device folder, run the following command to begin sending telemetry data to your IoT hub:

    ```cmd/sh
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App" 
    ```

    ![Java IoT Hub device app to send device-to-cloud messages][8]

3. The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal][lnk-portal] shows the number of messages sent to the IoT hub:

    ![Azure portal Usage tile showing number of messages sent to IoT Hub][43]

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the device app to send device-to-cloud messages to the IoT hub. You also created an app that displays the messages received by the IoT hub.
