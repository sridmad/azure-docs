# Get started with device twins (.NET/Node)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-twin-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you will have a .NET and a Node.js console app:

* **AddTagsAndQuery.sln**, a .NET back-end app, which adds tags and queries device twins.
* **TwinSimulatedDevice.js**, a Node.js app which simulates a device that connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and reports its connectivity condition.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [Azure IoT SDKs][lnk-hub-sdks] provides information about the Azure IoT SDKs that you can use to build both device and back-end apps.
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial you need the following:

* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* Node.js version 4.0.x or later.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account][lnk-free-trial] in just a couple of minutes.)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-device-identity.md)]

## Create the service app
In this section, you create a .NET console app (using C#) that adds location metadata to the device twin associated with **myDeviceId**. It then queries the device twins stored in the IoT hub selecting the devices located in the US, and then the ones that reported a cellular connection.

1. In Visual Studio, add a Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution by using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **AddTagsAndQuery**.
   
    ![New Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project][img-createapp]
1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **AddTagsAndQuery** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages...**.
1. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, select **Browse** and search for **microsoft.azure.devices**. Select **Install** to install the **Microsoft.Azure.Devices** package, and accept the terms of use. This procedure downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT service SDK][lnk-nuget-service-sdk] NuGet package and its dependencies.
   
    ![NuGet Package Manager window][img-servicenuget]
1. Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
1. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Replace the placeholder value with the IoT Hub connection string for the hub that you created in the previous section.
   
        static RegistryManager registryManager;
        static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
1. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        public static async Task AddTagsAndQuery()
        {
            var twin = await registryManager.GetTwinAsync("myDeviceId");
            var patch =
                @"{
                    tags: {
                        location: {
                            region: 'US',
                            plant: 'Redmond43'
                        }
                    }
                }";
            await registryManager.UpdateTwinAsync(twin.DeviceId, patch, twin.ETag);
   
            var query = registryManager.CreateQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43'", 100);
            var twinsInRedmond43 = await query.GetNextAsTwinAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Devices in Redmond43: {0}", string.Join(", ", twinsInRedmond43.Select(t => t.DeviceId)));
   
            query = registryManager.CreateQuery("SELECT * FROM devices WHERE tags.location.plant = 'Redmond43' AND properties.reported.connectivity.type = 'cellular'", 100);
            var twinsInRedmond43UsingCellular = await query.GetNextAsTwinAsync();
            Console.WriteLine("Devices in Redmond43 using cellular network: {0}", string.Join(", ", twinsInRedmond43UsingCellular.Select(t => t.DeviceId)));
        }
   
    The **RegistryManager** class exposes all the methods required to interact with device twins from the service. The previous code first initializes the **registryManager** object, then retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId**, and finally updates its tags with the desired location information.
   
    After updating, it executes two queries: the first selects only the device twins of devices located in the **Redmond43** plant, and the second refines the query to select only the devices that are also connected through cellular network.
   
    Note that the previous code, when it creates the **query** object, specifies a maximum number of returned documents. The **query** object contains a **HasMoreResults** boolean property that you can use to invoke the **GetNextAsTwinAsync** methods multiple times to retrieve all results. A method called **GetNextAsJson** is available for results that are not device twins, for example, results of aggregation queries.
1. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        registryManager = RegistryManager.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        AddTagsAndQuery().Wait();
        Console.WriteLine("Press Enter to exit.");
        Console.ReadLine();

1. In the Solution Explorer, open the **Set StartUp projects...** and make sure the **Action** for **AddTagsAndQuery** project is **Start**. Build the solution.
1. Run this application by right-clicking on the **AddTagsAndQuery** project and selecting **Debug**, followed by **Start new instance**. You should see one device in the results for the query asking for all devices located in **Redmond43** and none for the query that restricts the results to devices that use a cellular network.
   
    ![Query results in window][img-addtagapp]

In the next section, you create a device app that reports the connectivity information and changes the result of the query in the previous section.

## Create the device app
In this section, you create a Node.js console app that connects to your hub as **myDeviceId**, and then updates its reported properties to contain the information that it is connected using a cellular network.

1. Create a new empty folder called **reportconnectivity**. In the **reportconnectivity** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command prompt. Accept all the defaults.
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
1. At your command prompt in the **reportconnectivity** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device**, and **azure-iot-device-mqtt** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-mqtt --save
    ```
1. Using a text editor, create a new **ReportConnectivity.js** file in the **reportconnectivity** folder.
1. Add the following code to the **ReportConnectivity.js** file, and substitute the placeholder for device connection string with the one you copied when you created the **myDeviceId** device identity:
   
        'use strict';
        var Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
        var Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
   
        var connectionString = '{device connection string}';
        var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);
   
        client.open(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('could not open IotHub client');
        }  else {
            console.log('client opened');
   
            client.getTwin(function(err, twin) {
            if (err) {
                console.error('could not get twin');
            } else {
                var patch = {
                    connectivity: {
                        type: 'cellular'
                    }
                };
   
                twin.properties.reported.update(patch, function(err) {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error('could not update twin');
                    } else {
                        console.log('twin state reported');
                        process.exit();
                    }
                });
            }
            });
        }
        });
   
    The **Client** object exposes all the methods you require to interact with device twins from the device. The previous code, after it initializes the **Client** object, retrieves the device twin for **myDeviceId** and updates its reported property with the connectivity information.
1. Run the device app
   
        node ReportConnectivity.js
   
    You should see the message `twin state reported`.
1. Now that the device reported its connectivity information, it should appear in both queries. Run the .NET **AddTagsAndQuery** app to run the queries again. This time **myDeviceId** should appear in both query results.

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the Azure portal, and then created a device identity in the IoT hub's identity registry. You added device metadata as tags from a back-end app, and wrote a simulated device app to report device connectivity information in the device twin. You also learned how to query this information using the SQL-like IoT Hub query language.

Use the following resources to learn how to:

* send telemetry from devices with the [Get started with IoT Hub][lnk-iothub-getstarted] tutorial,
* configure devices using device twin's desired properties with the [Use desired properties to configure devices][lnk-twin-how-to-configure] tutorial,
* control devices interactively (such as turning on a fan from a user-controlled app) with the [Use direct methods][lnk-methods-tutorial] tutorial.
