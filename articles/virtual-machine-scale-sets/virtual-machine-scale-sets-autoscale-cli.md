# Automatically scale a virtual machine scale set with the Azure CLI 2.0
When you create a scale set, you define the number of VM instances that you wish to run. As your application demand changes, you can automatically increase or decrease the number of VM instances. The ability to autoscale lets you keep up with customer demand or respond to application performance changes throughout the lifecycle of your app.

This article shows you how to create autoscale rules with the Azure CLI 2.0 that monitor the performance of the VM instances in your scale set. These autoscale rules increase or decrease the number of VM instances in response to these performance metrics. You can also complete these steps with [Azure PowerShell](virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-powershell.md) or in the [Azure portal](virtual-machine-scale-sets-autoscale-portal.md).


## Prerequisites
To create autoscale rules, you need an existing virtual machine scale set. You can create a scale set with the [Azure portal](virtual-machine-scale-sets-portal-create.md), [Azure CLI 2.0](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create.md#create-from-azure-cli), or [Azure PowerShell](virtual-machine-scale-sets-create.md#create-from-powershell).

To make it easier to create the autoscale rules, define some variables for your scale set. The following example defines variables for the scale set named *myScaleSet* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup* and in the *eastus* region. Your subscription ID is obtained with [az account show](/cli/azure/account#az_account_show). If you have multiple subscriptions associated with your account, only the first subscription is returned. Adjust the names and subscription ID as follows:

```azurecli
sub=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)
resourcegroup_name="myResourceGroup"
scaleset_name="myScaleSet"
location_name="eastus"
```

## Define an autoscale profile
Autoscale rules are deployed as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) with the Azure CLI 2.0. The complete JSON that defines and deploys the autoscale rules can be found later in the article. 

The start of the autoscale profile defines the default, minimum, and maximum scale set capacity. The following example sets the default, and minimum, capacity of *2* VM instances, and a maximum of *10*:

```json
{
  "name": "autoscale rules",
  "capacity": {
    "minimum": "2",
    "maximum": "10",
    "default": "2"
  }
}
```


## Create a rule to automatically scale out
If your application demand increases, the load on the VM instances in your scale set increases. If this increased load is consistent, rather than just a brief demand, you can configure autoscale rules to increase the number of VM instances in the scale set. When these VM instances are created and your applications are deployed, the scale set starts to distribute traffic to them through the load balancer. You control what metrics to monitor, such as CPU or disk, how long the application load must meet a given threshold, and how many VM instances to add to the scale set.

Let's create a rule that increases the number of VM instances in a scale set when the average CPU load is greater than 70% over a 10-minute period. When the rule triggers, the number of VM instances is increased by 20%. In scale sets with a small number of VM instances, you could set the `type` to *ChangeCount* and increase the `value` by *1* or *2* instances. In scale sets with a large number of VM instances, an increase of 10% or 20% VM instances may be more appropriate.

The following parameters are used for this rule:

| Parameter         | Explanation                                                                                                         | Value           |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| *metricName*      | The performance metric to monitor and apply scale set actions on.                                                   | Percentage CPU  |
| *timeGrain*       | How often the metrics are collected for analysis.                                                                   | 1 minute        |
| *timeAggregation* | Defines how the collected metrics should be aggregated for analysis.                                                | Average         |
| *timeWindow*      | The amount of time monitored before the metric and threshold values are compared.                                   | 10 minutes      |
| *operator*        | Operator used to compare the metric data against the threshold.                                                     | Greater Than    |
| *threshold*       | The value that causes the autoscale rule to trigger an action.                                                      | 70%             |
| *direction*       | Defines if the scale set should scale up or down when the rule applies.                                             | Increase        |
| *type*            | Indicates that the number of VM instances should be changed by a percentage amount.                                 | Percent Change  |
| *value*           | How many VM instances should be scaled up or down when the rule applies.                                            | 20              |
| *cooldown*        | The amount of time to wait before the rule is applied again so that the autoscale actions have time to take effect. | 5 minutes       |

The following example defines the rule to scale out the number of VM instances. The *metricResourceUri* uses the variables previously defined for the subscription ID, resource group name, and scale set name:

```json
{
  "metricTrigger": {
    "metricName": "Percentage CPU",
    "metricNamespace": "",
    "metricResourceUri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'",
    "metricResourceLocation": "'$location_name'",
    "timeGrain": "PT1M",
    "statistic": "Average",
    "timeWindow": "PT10M",
    "timeAggregation": "Average",
    "operator": "GreaterThan",
    "threshold": 70
  },
  "scaleAction": {
    "direction": "Increase",
    "type": "PercentChangeCount",
    "value": "20",
    "cooldown": "PT5M"
  }
}
```


## Create a rule to automatically scale in
On an evening or weekend, your application demand may decrease. If this decreased load is consistent over a period of time, you can configure autoscale rules to decrease the number of VM instances in the scale set. This scale-in action reduces the cost to run your scale set as you only run the number of instances required to meet the current demand.

Create another rule that decreases the number of VM instances in a scale set when the average CPU load then drops below 30% over a 10-minute period. The following example defines the rule to scale out the number of VM instances. The *metricResourceUri* uses the variables previously defined for the subscription ID, resource group name, and scale set name:

```json
{
  "metricTrigger": {
    "metricName": "Percentage CPU",
    "metricNamespace": "",
    "metricResourceUri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'",
    "metricResourceLocation": "'$location_name'",
    "timeGrain": "PT1M",
    "statistic": "Average",
    "timeWindow": "PT10M",
    "timeAggregation": "Average",
    "operator": "LessThan",
    "threshold": 30
  },
  "scaleAction": {
    "direction": "Decrease",
    "type": "PercentChangeCount",
    "value": "20",
    "cooldown": "PT5M"
  }
}
```


## Apply autoscale rules to a scale set
The final step is to apply the autoscale profile and rules to your scale set. Your scale is then able to automatically scale in or out based on the application demand. Apply the autoscale profile with [az monitor autoscale-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/autoscale-settings#az_monitor_autoscale_settings_create) as follows. The complete JSON uses the profile and rules noted in the previous sections.

```azurecli
az monitor autoscale-settings create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name autoscale \
    --parameters '{"autoscale_setting_resource_name": "autoscale",
      "enabled": true,
      "location": "'$location_name'",
      "notifications": [],
      "profiles": [
        {
          "name": "autoscale by percentage based on CPU usage",
          "capacity": {
            "minimum": "2",
            "maximum": "10",
            "default": "2"
          },
          "rules": [
            {
              "metricTrigger": {
                "metricName": "Percentage CPU",
                "metricNamespace": "",
                "metricResourceUri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'",
                "metricResourceLocation": "'$location_name'",
                "timeGrain": "PT1M",
                "statistic": "Average",
                "timeWindow": "PT10M",
                "timeAggregation": "Average",
                "operator": "GreaterThan",
                "threshold": 70
              },
              "scaleAction": {
                "direction": "Increase",
                "type": "PercentChangeCount",
                "value": "20",
                "cooldown": "PT5M"
              }
            },
            {
              "metricTrigger": {
                "metricName": "Percentage CPU",
                "metricNamespace": "",
                "metricResourceUri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'",
                "metricResourceLocation": "'$location_name'",
                "timeGrain": "PT1M",
                "statistic": "Average",
                "timeWindow": "PT10M",
                "timeAggregation": "Average",
                "operator": "LessThan",
                "threshold": 30
              },
              "scaleAction": {
                "direction": "Decrease",
                "type": "PercentChangeCount",
                "value": "20",
                "cooldown": "PT5M"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "tags": {},
      "target_resource_uri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'"
    }'
```


## Monitor number of instances in a scale set
To see the number and status of VM instances, view a list of instances in your scale set with [az vmss list-instances](/cli/azure/vmss#az_vmss_list_instances). The status indicates if the VM instance is provisioning as the scale set automatically scales out, or is deprovisioning as the scale automatically scales in. The following example views the VM instance status for the scale set named *myScaleSet* in the resource group named *myResourceGroup*:

```azurecli
az vmss list-instances \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myScaleSet \
  --output table
```


## Autoscale based on a schedule
The previous examples automatically scaled a scale set in or out with basic host metrics such as CPU usage. You can also create autoscale rules based on schedules. These schedule-based rules allow you to automatically scale out the number of VM instances ahead of an anticipated increase in application demand, such as core work hours, and then automatically scale in the number of instances at a time that you anticipate less demand, such as the weekend.

To use schedule-based autoscale rules, create a JSON profile that defines the number of VM instances to run for a fixed start and end time window. The following example defines a rule to scale out to *10* instances at *9* A.M each work day (Monday through Friday).

```json
{
  "name": "Scale out during each work day",
  "capacity": {
      "minimum": "10",
      "maximum": "10",
      "default": "10"
  },
  "rules": [],
  "recurrence": {
      "frequency": "Week",
      "schedule": {
          "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time",
          "days": [
              "Monday",
              "Tuesday",
              "Wednesday",
              "Thursday",
              "Friday"
          ],
          "hours": [
              9
          ],
          "minutes": [
              0
          ]
      }
  }
}
```

To scale in during the evening, create another rule that specifies a lower number of VM instances and an appropriate start time.

The following complete example defines the rules to scale out and then scale in, then applies the autoscale profile with [az monitor autoscale-settings create](/cli/azure/monitor/autoscale-settings#az_monitor_autoscale_settings_create). This example overwrites the metric-based autoscale rules created in the previous examples. The *metricResourceUri* uses the variables previously defined for the subscription ID, resource group name, and scale set name:

```azurecli
az monitor autoscale-settings create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name autoscale \
    --parameters '{"autoscale_setting_resource_name": "autoscale",
      "enabled": true,
      "location": "'$location_name'",
      "notifications": [],
      "profiles": [
        {
          "name": "Scale out during each work day",
          "capacity": {
            "minimum": "10",
            "maximum": "10",
            "default": "10"
          },
          "rules": [],
          "recurrence": {
            "frequency": "Week",
            "schedule": {
              "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time",
              "days": [
                "Monday",
                "Tuesday",
                "Wednesday",
                "Thursday",
                "Friday"
              ],
              "hours": [
                9
              ],
              "minutes": [
                0
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Scale in during the evening",
          "capacity": {
            "minimum": "3",
            "maximum": "3",
            "default": "3"
          },
          "rules": [],
          "recurrence": {
            "frequency": "Week",
            "schedule": {
              "timeZone": "Pacific Standard Time",
              "days": [
                "Monday",
                "Tuesday",
                "Wednesday",
                "Thursday",
                "Friday"
              ],
              "hours": [
                18
              ],
              "minutes": [
                0
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      ],
      "tags": {},
      "target_resource_uri": "/subscriptions/'$sub'/resourceGroups/'$resourcegroup_name'/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/'$scaleset_name'"
    }'
```
