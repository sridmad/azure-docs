# Create your first function using the Azure CLI

This quickstart topic walks you through how to use Azure Functions to create your first function. You use the Azure CLI to create a function app, which is the [serverless](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/serverless-computing/) infrastructure that hosts your function. The function code itself is deployed from a GitHub sample repository.    

You can follow the steps below using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer. 

## Prerequisites 

Before running this sample, you must have the following:

+ An active [GitHub](https://github.com) account. 
+ An active Azure subscription.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version you have. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create a function app

You must have a function app to host the execution of your functions. The function app provides an environment for serverless execution of your function code. It lets you group functions as a logic unit for easier management, deployment, and sharing of resources. Create a function app by using the [az functionapp create](/cli/azure/functionapp#create) command. 

In the following command, substitute a unique function app name where you see the `<app_name>` placeholder and the storage account name for  `<storage_name>`. The `<app_name>` is used as the default DNS domain for the function app, and so the name needs to be unique across all apps in Azure. The _deployment-source-url_ parameter is a sample repository in GitHub that contains a "Hello World" HTTP triggered function.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --name <app_name> --storage-account  <storage_name>  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--consumption-plan-location westeurope --deployment-source-url https://github.com/Azure-Samples/functions-quickstart
```
Setting the _consumption-plan-location_ parameter means that the function app is hosted in a Consumption hosting plan. In this plan, resources are added dynamically as required by your functions and you only pay when functions are running. For more information, see [Choose the correct hosting plan](functions-scale.md). 

After the function app has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example:

```json
{
  "availabilityState": "Normal",
  "clientAffinityEnabled": true,
  "clientCertEnabled": false,
  "containerSize": 1536,
  "dailyMemoryTimeQuota": 0,
  "defaultHostName": "quickstart.azurewebsites.net",
  "enabled": true,
  "enabledHostNames": [
    "quickstart.azurewebsites.net",
    "quickstart.scm.azurewebsites.net"
  ],
   ....
    // Remaining output has been truncated for readability.
}
```
