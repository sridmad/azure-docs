# Build a web service front end for your application using ASP.NET Core
By default, Azure Service Fabric services do not provide a public interface to the web. To expose your application's functionality to HTTP clients, you have to create a web project to act as an entry point and then communicate from there to your individual services.

In this tutorial, we pick up where we left off in the [Creating your first application in Visual Studio](service-fabric-create-your-first-application-in-visual-studio.md) tutorial and add an ASP.NET Core web service in front of the stateful counter service. If you have not already done so, you should go back and step through that tutorial first.

## Set up your environment for ASP.NET Core

You need Visual Studio 2017 to follow along with this tutorial. Any edition will do. 

 - [Install Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/)

To develop ASP.NET Core Service Fabric applications, you should have the following workloads installed:
 - **Azure development** (under *Web & Cloud*)
 - **ASP.NET and web development** (under *Web & Cloud*)
 - **.NET Core cross-platform development** (under *Other Toolsets*)

>[!Note] 
>The .NET Core tools for Visual Studio 2015 are no longer being updated, however if you are still using Visual Studio 2015, you need to have [.NET Core VS 2015 Tooling Preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) installed.

## Add an ASP.NET Core service to your application
ASP.NET Core is a lightweight, cross-platform web development framework that you can use to create modern web UI and web APIs. 

Let's add an ASP.NET Web API project to our existing application.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click **Services** within the application project and choose **Add > New Service Fabric Service**.
   
    ![Adding a new service to an existing application][vs-add-new-service]
2. On the **Create a Service** page, choose **ASP.NET Core** and give it a name.
   
    ![Choosing ASP.NET web service in the new service dialog][vs-new-service-dialog]

3. The next page provides a set of ASP.NET Core project templates. Note that these are the same choices that you would see if you created an ASP.NET Core project outside of a Service Fabric application, with a small amount of additional code to register the service with the Service Fabric runtime. For this tutorial, choose **Web API**. However, you can apply the same concepts to building a full web application.
   
    ![Choosing ASP.NET project type][vs-new-aspnet-project-dialog]
   
    Once your Web API project is created, you should have two services in your application. As you continue to build your application, you can add more services in exactly the same way. Each can be independently versioned and upgraded.

## Run the application
To get a sense of what we've done, let's deploy the new application and take a look at the default behavior that the ASP.NET Core Web API template provides.

1. Press F5 in Visual Studio to debug the app.
2. When deployment is complete, Visual Studio launches a browser to the root of the ASP.NET Web API service. The ASP.NET Core Web API template doesn't provide default behavior for the root, so you should see a 404 error in the browser.
3. Add `/api/values` to the location in the browser. This invokes the `Get` method on the ValuesController in the Web API template. It returns the default response that is provided by the template--a JSON array that contains two strings:
   
    ![Default values returned from ASP.NET Core Web API template][browser-aspnet-template-values]
   
    By the end of the tutorial, this page will show the most recent counter value from our stateful service instead of the default strings.

## Connect the services
Service Fabric provides complete flexibility in how you communicate with reliable services. Within a single application, you might have services that are accessible via TCP, other services that are accessible via an HTTP REST API, and still other services that are accessible via web sockets. For background on the options available and the tradeoffs involved, see [Communicating with services](service-fabric-connect-and-communicate-with-services.md). In this tutorial, we use [Service Fabric Service Remoting](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-remoting.md), provided in the SDK.

In the Service Remoting approach (modeled on remote procedure calls or RPCs), you define an interface to act as the public contract for the service. Then, you use that interface to generate a proxy class for interacting with the service.

### Create the remoting interface
Let's start by creating the interface to act as the contract between the stateful service and other services, in this case the ASP.NET Core web project. This interface must be shared by all services that use it to make RPC calls, so we'll create it in its own Class Library project.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click your solution and choose **Add** > **New Project**.

2. Choose the **Visual C#** entry in the left navigation pane and then select the **Class Library** template. Ensure that the .NET Framework version is set to **4.5.2**.
   
    ![Creating an interface project for your stateful service][vs-add-class-library-project]

3. Install the **Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting** NuGet package. Search for  **Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting** in the NuGet package manager and install it for all projects in the solution that use Service Remoting, including:
   - The Class Library project that contains the service interface
   - The Stateful Service project
   - The ASP.NET Core web service project
   
    ![Adding the Services NuGet package][vs-services-nuget-package]

4. In the class library, create an interface with a single method, `GetCountAsync`, and extend the interface from `Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.IService`. The remoting interface must derive from this interface to indicate that it is a Service Remoting interface.
   
    ```c#
    using Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
        
    ...

    namespace MyStatefulService.Interface
    {
        public interface ICounter: IService
        {
            Task<long> GetCountAsync();
        }
    }
    ```

### Implement the interface in your stateful service
Now that we have defined the interface, we need to implement it in the stateful service.

1. In your stateful service, add a reference to the class library project that contains the interface.
   
    ![Adding a reference to the class library project in the stateful service][vs-add-class-library-reference]
2. Locate the class that inherits from `StatefulService`, such as `MyStatefulService`, and extend it to implement the `ICounter` interface.
   
    ```c#
    using MyStatefulService.Interface;
   
    ...
   
    public class MyStatefulService : StatefulService, ICounter
    {        
         ...
    }
    ```
3. Now implement the single method that is defined in the `ICounter` interface, `GetCountAsync`.
   
    ```c#
    public async Task<long> GetCountAsync()
    {
        var myDictionary = 
            await this.StateManager.GetOrAddAsync<IReliableDictionary<string, long>>("myDictionary");
   
        using (var tx = this.StateManager.CreateTransaction())
        {          
            var result = await myDictionary.TryGetValueAsync(tx, "Counter");
            return result.HasValue ? result.Value : 0;
        }
    }
    ```

### Expose the stateful service using a service remoting listener
With the `ICounter` interface implemented, the final step is to open the Service Remoting communication channel. For stateful services, Service Fabric provides an overridable method called `CreateServiceReplicaListeners`. With this method, you can specify one or more communication listeners, based on the type of communication that you want to enable for your service.

> [!NOTE]
> The equivalent method for opening a communication channel to stateless services is called `CreateServiceInstanceListeners`.

In this case, we replace the existing `CreateServiceReplicaListeners` method and provide an instance of `ServiceRemotingListener`, which creates an RPC endpoint that is callable from clients through `ServiceProxy`.  

The `CreateServiceRemotingListener` extension method on the `IService` interface allows you to easily create a `ServiceRemotingListener` with all default settings. To use this extension method, ensure you have the `Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.Runtime` namespace imported. 

```c#
using Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.Runtime;

...

protected override IEnumerable<ServiceReplicaListener> CreateServiceReplicaListeners()
{
    return new List<ServiceReplicaListener>()
    {
        new ServiceReplicaListener(
            (context) =>
                this.CreateServiceRemotingListener(context))
    };
}
```


### Use the ServiceProxy class to interact with the service
Our stateful service is now ready to receive traffic from other services over RPC. So all that remains is adding the code to communicate with it from the ASP.NET web service.

1. In your ASP.NET project, add a reference to the class library that contains the `ICounter` interface.

2. Earlier you added the **Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting** NuGet package to the ASP.NET project. This package provides the `ServiceProxy` class which you use to make RPC calls to the stateful service. Ensure this NuGet package is installed in the ASP.NET Core web service project.

4. In the **Controllers** folder, open the `ValuesController` class. Note that the `Get` method currently just returns a hard-coded string array of "value1" and "value2"--which matches what we saw earlier in the browser. Replace this implementation with the following code:
   
    ```c#
    using MyStatefulService.Interface;
    using Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Client;
    using Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.Remoting.Client;
   
    ...

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IEnumerable<string>> Get()
    {
        ICounter counter =
            ServiceProxy.Create<ICounter>(new Uri("fabric:/MyApplication/MyStatefulService"), new ServicePartitionKey(0));
   
        long count = await counter.GetCountAsync();
   
        return new string[] { count.ToString() };
    }
    ```
   
    The first line of code is the key one. To create the ICounter proxy to the stateful service, you need to provide two pieces of information: a partition ID and the name of the service.
   
    You can use partitioning to scale stateful services by breaking up their state into different buckets, based on a key that you define, such as a customer ID or postal code. In our trivial application, the stateful service only has one partition, so the key doesn't matter. Any key that you provide will lead to the same partition. To learn more about partitioning services, see [How to partition Service Fabric Reliable Services](service-fabric-concepts-partitioning.md).
   
    The service name is a URI of the form fabric:/&lt;application_name&gt;/&lt;service_name&gt;.
   
    With these two pieces of information, Service Fabric can uniquely identify the machine that requests should be sent to. The `ServiceProxy` class also seamlessly handles the case where the machine that hosts the stateful service partition fails and another machine must be promoted to take its place. This abstraction makes writing the client code to deal with other services significantly simpler.
   
    Once we have the proxy, we simply invoke the `GetCountAsync` method and return its result.

5. Press F5 again to run the modified application. As before, Visual Studio automatically launches the browser to the root of the web project. Add the "api/values" path, and you should see the current counter value returned.
   
    ![The stateful counter value displayed in the browser][browser-aspnet-counter-value]
   
    Refresh the browser periodically to see the counter value update.

## Connecting to a Reliable Actor service
This tutorial focused on adding a web front end that communicated with a stateful service. However, you can follow a very similar model to talk to actors. When you create a Reliable Actor project, Visual Studio automatically generates an interface project for you. You can use that interface to generate an actor proxy in the web project to communicate with the actor. The communication channel is provided automatically. So you do not need to do anything that is equivalent to establishing a `ServiceRemotingListener` like you did for the stateful service in this tutorial.

## How web services work on your local cluster
In general, you can deploy exactly the same Service Fabric application to a multi-machine cluster that you deployed on your local cluster and be highly confident that it works as you expect. This is because your local cluster is simply a five-node configuration that is collapsed to a single machine.

When it comes to web services, however, there is one key nuance. When your cluster sits behind a load balancer, as it does in Azure, you must ensure that your web services are deployed on every machine since the load balancer simply round-robins traffic across the machines. You can do this by setting the `InstanceCount` for the service to the special value of "-1".

By contrast, when you run a web service locally, you need to ensure that only one instance of the service is running. Otherwise, you run into conflicts from multiple processes that are listening on the same path and port. As a result, the web service instance count should be set to "1" for local deployments.

To learn how to configure different values for different environment, see [Managing application parameters for multiple environments](service-fabric-manage-multiple-environment-app-configuration.md).

## Next steps
Now that you have a web front end set up for your application with ASP.NET Core, learn more about [ASP.NET Core in Service Fabric Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore.md) for an in-depth understanding of how ASP.NET Core works with Service Fabric.

Next, [learn more about communicating with services](service-fabric-connect-and-communicate-with-services.md) in general to get a complete picture of how service communication works in Service Fabric.

Once you have a good understanding of how service communication works, [create a cluster in Azure and deploy your application to the cloud](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-portal.md).
