| --- | --- |
| --debug              | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs.|
| --help -h            | Show this help message and exit.|

## sfctl application delete
Deletes an existing Service Fabric application.

Deletes an existing Service Fabric application. An application must be created before it can be deleted. Deleting an application deletes all services that are part of that application. By default Service Fabric tries to close service replicas in a graceful manner and then delete the service. However if service is having issues closing the replica gracefully, the delete operation may take a long time or get stuck. Use the optional ForceRemove flag to skip the graceful close sequence and forcefully delete the application and all of its services.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --application-id [Required]| The identity of the application. This is typically the full name of        the application without the 'fabric:' URI scheme. Starting from version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "~" character. For example, if the application name is "fabric://myapp/app1", the application identity would be "myapp~app1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1" in previous versions.|
| --force-remove          | Remove a Service Fabric application or service forcefully without        going through the graceful shutdown sequence. This parameter can be        used to forcefully delete an application or service for which        delete is timing out due to issues in the service code that        prevents graceful close of replicas.|
| --timeout -t            | Server timeout in seconds.  Default: 60.|

### Global Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --debug                 | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs.|
| --help -h               | Show this help message and exit.|
| --output -o             | Output format.  Allowed values: json, jsonc, table, tsv.  Default:        json.|
| --query                 | JMESPath query string. See http://jmespath.org/ for more        information and examples.|
| --verbose               | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs.|

## sfctl application deployed

## sfctl application type

Gets the list of application types in the Service Fabric cluster matching exactly the specified name.

Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. These results are of application types whose name match exactly the one specified as the parameter, and which comply with the given query parameters. All versions of the application type matching the application type name are returned, with each version returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status, and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first 3 application types, or if max results is set to 3, then 3 is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --application-type-name [Required]| The name of the application type.|
| --continuation-token           | The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set               of results. A continuation token with a non empty value is               included in the response of the API when the results from               the system do not fit in a single response. When this value               is passed to the next API call, the API returns next set of               results. If there are no further results, then the               continuation token does not contain a value. The value of               this parameter should not be URL encoded.|
| --exclude-application-parameters  | The flag that specifies whether application parameters will               be excluded from the result.|
| --max-results                  | The maximum number of results to be returned as part of the               paged queries. This parameter defines the upper bound on the               number of results returned. The results returned can be less               than the specified maximum results if they do not fit in the               message as per the max message size restrictions defined in               the configuration. If this parameter is zero or not               specified, the paged query includes as much results as               possible that fit in the return message.|
| --timeout -t                   | Server timeout in seconds.  Default: 60.|
