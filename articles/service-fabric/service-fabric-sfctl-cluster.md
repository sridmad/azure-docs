## sfctl cluster health
Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster.

Gets the health of a Service Fabric cluster. Use EventsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of health events reported on the cluster based on the health state. Similarly, use NodesHealthStateFilter and ApplicationsHealthStateFilter to filter the collection of nodes and applications returned based on their aggregated health state. 

### Arguments

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
| --applications-health-state-filter| Allows filtering of the application health state  objects returned in the result of cluster health  query based on their health state. The possible  values for this parameter include integer value  obtained from members or bitwise operations on  members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only  applications that match the filter are returned.  All applications are used to evaluate the  aggregated health state. If not specified, all  entries are returned. The state values are flag  based enumeration, so the value could be a  combination of these values obtained using  bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, if the  provided value is 6 then health state of  applications with HealthState value of OK (2)  and Warning (4) are returned. - Default -  Default value. Matches any HealthState. The  value is zero. - None - Filter that doesn't  match any HealthState value. Used in order to  return no results on a given collection of  states. The value is 1. - Ok - Filter that  matches input with HealthState value Ok. The  value is 2. - Warning - Filter that matches  input with HealthState value Warning. The value  is 4. - Error - Filter that matches input with  HealthState value Error. The value is 8. - All -  Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.|
| --events-health-state-filter   | Allows filtering the collection of HealthEvent  objects returned based on health state. The  possible values for this parameter include  integer value of one of the following health  states. Only events that match the filter are  returned. All events are used to evaluate the  aggregated health state. If not specified, all  entries are returned. The state values are flag-                                                    based enumeration, so the value could be a  combination of these values obtained using  bitwise 'OR' operator. For example, If the  provided value is 6 then all of the events with  HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are  returned. - Default - Default value. Matches any  HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter  that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used  in order to return no results on a given  collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok -  Filter that matches input with HealthState value  Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that  matches input with HealthState value Warning.  The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches  input with HealthState value Error. The value is  8. - All - Filter that matches input with any  HealthState value. The value is 65535.|
|--exclude-health-statistics                   | Indicates whether the health statistics should  be returned as part of the query result. False  by default. The statistics show the number of  children entities in health state Ok, Warning,  and Error.|
 |   --include-system-application-health-statistics| Indicates whether the health statistics should  include the fabric:/System application health  statistics. False by default. If  IncludeSystemApplicationHealthStatistics is set  to true, the health statistics include the  entities that belong to the fabric:/System  application. Otherwise, the query result  includes health statistics only for user  applications. The health statistics must be  included in the query result for this parameter  to be applied.|
| --nodes-health-state-filter    | Allows filtering of the node health state  objects returned in the result of cluster health  query based on their health state. The possible  values for this parameter include integer value  of one of the following health states. Only  nodes that match the filter are returned. All  nodes are used to evaluate the aggregated health  state. If not specified, all entries are  returned. The state values are flag-based  enumeration, so the value could be a combination  of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR'  operator. For example, if the provided value is  "6" then health state of nodes with HealthState  value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned. -  Default - Default value. Matches any  HealthState. The value is zero. - None - Filter  that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used  in order to return no results on a given  collection of states. The value is 1. - Ok -  Filter that matches input with HealthState value  Ok. The value is 2. - Warning - Filter that  matches input with HealthState value Warning.  The value is 4. - Error - Filter that matches  input with HealthState value Error. The value is  8. - All - Filter that matches input with any  HealthState value. The value is 65535.|
| --timeout -t                   | Server timeout in seconds.  Default: 60.|

## sfctl cluster manifest
Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest.

Get the Service Fabric cluster manifest. The cluster manifest contains properties of the cluster that include different node types on the cluster, security configurations, fault, and upgrade domain topologies etc. These properties are specified as part of the ClusterConfig.JSON file while deploying a standalone cluster. However, most of the information in the cluster manifest is generated internally by service fabric during cluster deployment in other deployment scenarios (for example when using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)). The contents of the cluster manifest are for informational purposes only and users are not expected to take a dependency on the format of the file contents or its interpretation.

|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
|    --app-health-map                      | JSON encoded dictionary of pairs of application name and maximum percentage unhealthy before raising error.|
 |   --app-type-health-map                 | JSON encoded dictionary of pairs of application type name and maximum percentage unhealthy before raising error.|
 |   --code-version                        | The cluster code version.|
 |   --config-version                      | The cluster configuration version.|
 |   --delta-health-evaluation             | Enables delta health evaluation rather than absolute health evaluation after completion of each upgrade domain.|
 |   --delta-unhealthy-nodes               | The maximum allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during cluster upgrades.  Default: 10. The delta is measured between the state of the nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the nodes at the time of the health evaluation. The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion to make sure the global state of the cluster is within tolerated limits.|
 |   --failure-action                      | Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'Rollback', 'Manual'.|
 |   --force-restart                       | Force restart.|
 |   --health-check-retry                  | Health check retry timeout measured in milliseconds.|
 |   --health-check-stable                 | Health check stable duration measured in milliseconds.|
  |  --health-check-wait                   | Health check wait duration measured in milliseconds.|
  |  --replica-set-check-timeout           | Upgrade replica set check timeout measured in seconds.|
 |   --rolling-upgrade-mode                | Possible values include: 'Invalid', 'UnmonitoredAuto', 'UnmonitoredManual', 'Monitored'.  Default: UnmonitoredAuto.|
  |  --timeout -t                          | Server timeout in seconds.  Default: 60.|
  |  --unhealthy-applications              | The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10. The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error. If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy application, the health is evaluated as Warning. This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy applications over the total number of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications of application types that are included in the ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap. The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications.|
 |   --unhealthy-nodes                     | The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10. The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error. If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health is evaluated as Warning. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes in the cluster. The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes. In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.|
 |   --upgrade-domain-delta-unhealthy-nodes| The maximum allowed percentage of upgrade domain nodes health degradation allowed during cluster upgrades. Default: 15. The delta is measured between the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the beginning of upgrade and the state of the upgrade domain nodes at the time of the health evaluation. The check is performed after every upgrade domain upgrade completion for all completed upgrade domains to make sure the state of the upgrade domains is within tolerated limits.|
 |   --upgrade-domain-timeout              | Upgrade domain timeout measured in milliseconds.|
 |   --upgrade-timeout                     | Upgrade timeout measured in milliseconds.|
 |   --warning-as-error                    | Warnings are treated with the same severity as errors.|

### Global Arguments
|Argument|Description|
| --- | --- |
|--debug                               | Increase logging verbosity to show all debug logs.|
|    --help -h                             | Show this help message and exit.|
|    --output -o                           | Output format.  Allowed values: json, jsonc, table, tsv. Default: json.|
|    --query                               | JMESPath query string. See http://jmespath.org/ for more information and examples.|
|    --verbose                             | Increase logging verbosity. Use --debug for full debug logs.|
