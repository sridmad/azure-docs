# Deploy a Service Fabric Linux cluster into an Azure virtual network
This tutorial is part one of a series. You will learn how to deploy a Linux Service Fabric cluster into an existing Azure virtual network (VNET) and sub-net using Azure CLI. When you're finished, you have a cluster running in the cloud that you can deploy applications to. To create a Windows cluster using PowerShell, see [Create a secure Windows cluster on Azure](service-fabric-tutorial-create-vnet-and-windows-cluster.md).

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial:
- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- Install the [Service Fabric CLI](service-fabric-cli.md)
- Install the [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

The following procedures create a five-node Service Fabric cluster. To calculate cost incurred by running a Service Fabric cluster in Azure use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

## Introduction
This tutorial deploys a cluster of five nodes in a single node type into a virtual network in Azure.

A [Service Fabric cluster](service-fabric-deploy-anywhere.md) is a network-connected set of virtual or physical machines into which your microservices are deployed and managed. Clusters can scale to thousands of machines. A machine or VM that is part of a cluster is called a node. Each node is assigned a node name (a string). Nodes have characteristics such as placement properties.

A node type defines the size, number, and properties for a set of virtual machines in the cluster. Every defined node type is set up as a [virtual machine scale set](/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/), an Azure compute resource you use to deploy and manage a collection of virtual machines as a set. Each node type can then be scaled up or down independently, have different sets of ports open, and can have different capacity metrics. Node types are used to define roles for a set of cluster nodes, such as "front end" or "back end".  Your cluster can have more than one node type, but the primary node type must have at least five VMs for production clusters (or at least three VMs for test clusters).  [Service Fabric system services](service-fabric-technical-overview.md#system-services) are placed on the nodes of the primary node type.

## Cluster capacity planning
This tutorial deploys a cluster of five nodes in a single node type.  For any production cluster deployment, capacity planning is an important step. Here are some things to consider as a part of that process.

- The number of node types your cluster needs 
- The properties of each of node type (for example size, primary, internet facing, and number of VMs)
- The reliability and durability characteristics of the cluster

For more information, see [Cluster capacity planning considerations](service-fabric-cluster-capacity.md).

## Sign-in to Azure and select your subscription
This guide uses Azure CLI. When you start a new session, sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription before you execute Azure commands.
 
Run the following script to sign in to your Azure account select your subscription:

```azurecli
az login
az account set --subscription <guid>
```

## Create a resource group
Create a new resource group for your deployment and give it a name and a location.

```azurecli
ResourceGroupName="sflinuxclustergroup"
Location="southcentralus"
az group create --name $ResourceGroupName --location $Location
```

## Deploy the network topology
Next, set up the network topology to which API Management and the Service Fabric cluster will be deployed. The [network.json][network-arm] Resource Manager template is configured to create a virtual network (VNET) and also a subnet and network security group (NSG) for Service Fabric and a subnet and NSG for API Management. Learn more about VNETs, subnets, and NSGs [here](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

The [network.parameters.json][network-parameters-arm] parameters file contains the names of the subnets and NSGs that Service Fabric and API Management deploy to.  API Management is deployed in the [following tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-api-management.md). For this guide, the parameter values do not need to be changed. The Service Fabric Resource Manager templates use these values.  If the values are modified here, you must modify them in the other Resource Manager templates used in this tutorial and the [Deploy API Management tutorial](service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-api-management.md). 

Download the following Resource Manager template and parameters file:
- [network.json][network-arm]
- [network.parameters.json][network-parameters-arm]

Use the following script to deploy the Resource Manager template and parameter files for the network setup:

```azurecli
az group deployment create \
    --name VnetDeployment \
    --resource-group $ResourceGroupName \
    --template-file network.json \
    --parameters @network.parameters.json
```
<a id="createvaultandcert" name="createvaultandcert_anchor"></a>
## Deploy the Service Fabric cluster
Once the network resources have finished deploying, the next step is to deploy a Service Fabric cluster to the VNET in the subnet and NSG designated for the Service Fabric cluster. Deploying a cluster to an existing VNET and subnet (deployed previously in this article) requires a Resource Manager template.  For more information, see [Create a cluster by using Azure Resource Manager](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-arm.md). For this tutorial series, the template is pre-configured to use the names of the VNET, subnet, and NSG that you set up in a previous step.  

Download the following Resource Manager template and parameters file:
- [linuxcluster.json][cluster-arm]
- [linuxcluster.parameters.json][cluster-parameters-arm]

Use this template to create a secure cluster.  A cluster certificate is an X.509 certificate used to secure node-to-node communication and authenticate the cluster management endpoints to a management client.  The cluster certificate also provides an SSL for the HTTPS management API and for Service Fabric Explorer over HTTPS. Azure Key Vault is used to manage certificates for Service Fabric clusters in Azure.  When a cluster is deployed in Azure, the Azure resource provider responsible for creating Service Fabric clusters pulls certificates from Key Vault and installs them on the cluster VMs. 

You can use a certificate from a certificate authority (CA) as the cluster certificate or, for testing purposes, create a self-signed certificate. The cluster certificate must:

- contain a private key.
- be created for key exchange, which is exportable to a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file.
- have a subject name that matches the domain that you use to access the Service Fabric cluster. This matching is required to provide SSL for the cluster's HTTPS management endpoints and Service Fabric Explorer. You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for the .cloudapp.azure.com domain. You must obtain a custom domain name for your cluster. When you request a certificate from a CA, the certificate's subject name must match the custom domain name that you use for your cluster.

Fill in these empty parameters in the *linuxcluster.parameters.json* file for your deployment:

|Parameter|Value|
|---|---|
|adminPassword|Password#1234|
|adminUserName|vmadmin|
|clusterName|mysfcluster|

Leave the **certificateThumbprint**, **certificateUrlValue**, and **sourceVaultValue** parameters blank to create a self-signed certificate.  If you want to use an existing certificate previously uploaded to a key vault, fill in those parameter values.

The following script uses the [az sf cluster create](/cli/azure/sf/cluster?view=azure-cli-latest#az_sf_cluster_create) command and template to deploy a new cluster in Azure. The cmdlet also creates a new key vault in Azure, adds a new self-signed certificate to the key vault, and downloads the certificate file locally. You can specify an existing certificate and/or key vault by using other parameters of the [az sf cluster create](/cli/azure/sf/cluster?view=azure-cli-latest#az_sf_cluster_create) command.

```azurecli
Password="q6D7nN%6ck@6"
Subject="mysfcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com"
VaultName="linuxclusterkeyvault"
az group create --name $ResourceGroupName --location $Location

az sf cluster create --resource-group $ResourceGroupName --location $Location \
   --certificate-output-folder . --certificate-password $Password --certificate-subject-name $Subject \
   --vault-name $VaultName --vault-resource-group $ResourceGroupName  \
   --template-file linuxcluster.json --parameter-file linuxcluster.parameters.json

```

## Connect to the secure cluster
Connect to the cluster using the Service Fabric CLI `sfctl cluster select` command using your key.  Note, only use the **--no-verify** option for a self-signed certificate.

```azurecli
sfctl cluster select --endpoint https://aztestcluster.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080 \
--pem ./aztestcluster201709151446.pem --no-verify
```

Check that you are connected and the cluster is healthy using the `sfctl cluster health` command.

```azurecli
sfctl cluster health
```

## Clean up resources
The other articles in this tutorial series use the cluster you just created. If you're not immediately moving on to the next article, you might want to delete the cluster to avoid incurring charges. The simplest way to delete the cluster and all the resources it consumes is to delete the resource group.

Log in to Azure and select the subscription ID with which you want to remove the cluster.  You can find your subscription ID by logging in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). Delete the resource group and all the cluster resources using the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_delete) command.

```azurecli
az group delete --name $ResourceGroupName
```
