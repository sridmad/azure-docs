This step-by-step guide walks you through setting up a secure Azure Service Fabric cluster in Azure by using Azure Resource Manager. We acknowledge that the article is long. Nevertheless, unless you are already thoroughly familiar with the content, be sure to follow each step carefully.

The guide covers the following procedures:

* Setting up an Azure key vault to upload certificates for cluster and application security
* Creating a secured cluster in Azure by using Azure Resource Manager
* Authenticating users by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for cluster management

A secure cluster is a cluster that prevents unauthorized access to management operations. This includes deploying, upgrading, and deleting applications, services, and the data they contain. An unsecure cluster is a cluster that anyone can connect to at any time and perform management operations. Although it is possible to create an unsecure cluster, we highly recommend that you create a secure cluster from the outset. Because an unsecure cluster cannot be secured later, a new cluster must be created.

The concept of creating secure clusters is the same, whether they are Linux or Windows clusters. For more information and helper scripts for creating secure Linux clusters, see [Creating secure clusters on Linux](#Create-secure-clusters-on-Linux).

## Sign in to your Azure account
This guide uses [Azure PowerShell][azure-powershell]. When you start a new PowerShell session, sign in to your Azure account and select your subscription before you execute Azure commands.

Sign in to your Azure account:

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

Select your subscription:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmSubscription
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <guid>
```

## Set up a key vault
This section discusses creating a key vault for a Service Fabric cluster in Azure and for Service Fabric applications. For a complete guide to Azure Key Vault, refer to the [Key Vault getting started guide][key-vault-get-started].

Service Fabric uses X.509 certificates to secure a cluster and provide application security features. You use Key Vault to manage certificates for Service Fabric clusters in Azure. When a cluster is deployed in Azure, the Azure resource provider that's responsible for creating Service Fabric clusters pulls certificates from Key Vault and installs them on the cluster VMs.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between Azure Key Vault, a Service Fabric cluster, and the Azure resource provider that uses certificates stored in a key vault when it creates a cluster:

![Diagram of certificate installation][cluster-security-cert-installation]

### Create a resource group
The first step is to create a resource group specifically for your key vault. We recommend that you put the key vault into its own resource group. This action lets you remove the compute and storage resource groups, including the resource group that contains your Service Fabric cluster, without losing your keys and secrets. The resource group that contains your key vault _must be in the same region_ as the cluster that is using it.

If you plan to deploy clusters in multiple regions, we suggest that you name the resource group and the key vault in a way that indicates which region it belongs to.  

```powershell

    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name westus-mykeyvault -Location 'West US'
```
The output should look like this:

```powershell

    WARNING: The output object type of this cmdlet is going to be modified in a future release.

    ResourceGroupName : westus-mykeyvault
    Location          : westus
    ProvisioningState : Succeeded
    Tags              :
    ResourceId        : /subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/westus-mykeyvault

```

### Create a key vault in the new resource group
The key vault _must be enabled for deployment_ to allow the compute resource provider to get certificates from it and install it on virtual machine instances:

```powershell
    $vaultName = 'mywestusvault'
    New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $vaultName -ResourceGroupName 'westus-mykeyvault' -Location 'West US' -EnabledForDeployment

```

The output should look like this:

```powershell

    Vault Name                       : mywestusvault
    Resource Group Name              : westus-mykeyvault
    Location                         : West US
    Resource ID                      : /subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/westus-mykeyvault/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mywestusvault
    Vault URI                        : https://mywestusvault.vault.azure.net
    Tenant ID                        : <guid>
    SKU                              : Standard
    Enabled For Deployment?          : False
    Enabled For Template Deployment? : False
    Enabled For Disk Encryption?     : False
    Access Policies                  :
                                       Tenant ID                :    <guid>
                                       Object ID                :    <guid>
                                       Application ID           :
                                       Display Name             :    
                                       Permissions to Keys      :    get, create, delete, list, update, import, backup, restore
                                       Permissions to Secrets   :    all


    Tags                             :
```

## Use an existing key vault

To use an existing key vault, you _must enable it for deployment_ to allow the compute resource provider to get certificates from it and install it on cluster nodes:

```powershell

Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName 'ContosoKeyVault' -EnabledForDeployment

```

## Add certificates to your key vault

Certificates are used in Service Fabric to provide authentication and encryption to secure various aspects of a cluster and its applications. For more information on how certificates are used in Service Fabric, see [Service Fabric cluster security scenarios][service-fabric-cluster-security].

### Cluster and server certificate (required)
This certificate is required to secure a cluster and prevent unauthorized access to it. It provides cluster security in two ways:

* Cluster authentication: Authenticates node-to-node communication for cluster federation. Only nodes that can prove their identity with this certificate can join the cluster.
* Server authentication: Authenticates the cluster management endpoints to a management client, so that the management client knows it is talking to the real cluster. This certificate also provides an SSL for the HTTPS management API and for Service Fabric Explorer over HTTPS.

To serve these purposes, the certificate must meet the following requirements:

* The certificate must contain a private key.
* The certificate must be created for key exchange, which is exportable to a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file.
* The certificate's subject name must match the domain that you use to access the Service Fabric cluster. This matching is required to provide an SSL for the cluster's HTTPS management endpoints and Service Fabric Explorer. You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) for the .cloudapp.azure.com domain. You must obtain a custom domain name for your cluster. When you request a certificate from a CA, the certificate's subject name must match the custom domain name that you use for your cluster.

### Application certificates (optional)
Any number of additional certificates can be installed on a cluster for application security purposes. Before creating your cluster, consider the application security scenarios that require a certificate to be installed on the nodes, such as:

* Encryption and decryption of application configuration values.
* Encryption of data across nodes during replication.

### Managing certificates in Azure Key Vault
Key Vault supports creating, uploading and managing lifetime of certificates. See blog post on [Getting started with Azure Key Vault certificates](key-vault-certificates-getting-started) for details and options.

#### Uploading an existing certificate
In the powershell window created earlier, run the following commands to upload an existing certificate to Azure Key Vault.

```powershell
# Change values as required
# Password of PFX as secure string
$securepfxpwd = ConvertTo-SecureString –String '<password>' –AsPlainText –Force

Import-AzureKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName '<vault_name>' -Name '<certificate_name>' -FilePath '<path_to_pfx_file>' -Password $securepfxpwd
```

#### Creating a self-signed certificate in key vault
Following commands create a self signed certificate with 12 month validity in Azure Key Vault.

```powershell
# Change values as required. Make sure that Subject Name matches URL of cluster
$policy = New-AzureKeyVaultCertificatePolicy -SubjectName "CN=<Url_of_SF_cluster>" -IssuerName Self -ValidityInMonths 12

Add-AzureKeyVaultCertificate -VaultName '<vaultName>' -Name <certificate_name> -CertificatePolicy $policy
```

 At this point, you should have the following elements in place:

* The key vault resource group.
* The key vault and its URL.
* The cluster server authentication certificate and its URL in the key vault.
* The application certificates and their URLs in the key vault.

## Set up Azure Active Directory for client authentication

Azure AD enables organizations (known as tenants) to manage user access to applications. Applications are divided into those with a web-based sign-in UI and those with a native client experience. In this article, we assume that you have already created a tenant. If you have not, start by reading [How to get an Azure Active Directory tenant][active-directory-howto-tenant].

A Service Fabric cluster offers several entry points to its management functionality, including the web-based [Service Fabric Explorer][service-fabric-visualizing-your-cluster] and [Visual Studio][service-fabric-manage-application-in-visual-studio]. As a result, you create two Azure AD applications to control access to the cluster, one web application and one native application.

To simplify some of the steps involved in configuring Azure AD with a Service Fabric cluster, we have created a set of Windows PowerShell scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> You must complete the following steps before you create the cluster. Because the scripts expect cluster names and endpoints, the values should be planned and not values that you have already created.

1. [Download the scripts][sf-aad-ps-script-download] to your computer.
2. Right-click the zip file, select **Properties**, select the **Unblock** check box, and then click **Apply**.
3. Extract the zip file.
4. Run `SetupApplications.ps1`, and provide the TenantId, ClusterName, and WebApplicationReplyUrl as parameters. For example:

    ```powershell
    .\SetupApplications.ps1 -TenantId '690ec069-8200-4068-9d01-5aaf188e557a' -ClusterName 'mycluster' -WebApplicationReplyUrl 'https://mycluster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19080/Explorer/index.html'
    ```

    You can find your TenantId by executing the PowerShell command `Get-AzureSubscription`. Executing this command displays the TenantId for every subscription.

    ClusterName is used to prefix the Azure AD applications that are created by the script. It does not need to match the actual cluster name exactly. It is intended only to make it easier to map Azure AD artifacts to the Service Fabric cluster that they're being used with.

    WebApplicationReplyUrl is the default endpoint that Azure AD returns to your users after they finish signing in. Set this endpoint as the Service Fabric Explorer endpoint for your cluster, which by default is:

    https://&lt;cluster_domain&gt;:19080/Explorer

    You are prompted to sign in to an account that has administrative privileges for the Azure AD tenant. After you sign in, the script creates the web and native applications to represent your Service Fabric cluster. If you look at the tenant's applications in the [Azure classic portal][azure-classic-portal], you should see two new entries:

   * *ClusterName*\_Cluster
   * *ClusterName*\_Client

   The script prints the JSON required by the Azure Resource Manager template when you create the cluster in the next section, so it's a good idea to keep the PowerShell window open.

```json
"azureActiveDirectory": {
  "tenantId":"<guid>",
  "clusterApplication":"<guid>",
  "clientApplication":"<guid>"
},
```

## Create a Service Fabric cluster Resource Manager template
In this section, the outputs of the preceding PowerShell commands are used in a Service Fabric cluster Resource Manager template.

Sample Resource Manager templates are available in the [Azure quick-start template gallery on GitHub][azure-quickstart-templates]. These templates can be used as a starting point for your cluster template.

### Create the Resource Manager template
This guide uses the [5-node secure cluster][service-fabric-secure-cluster-5-node-1-nodetype] example template and template parameters. Download `azuredeploy.json` and `azuredeploy.parameters.json` to your computer and open both files in your favorite text editor.

### Add certificates
You add certificates to a cluster Resource Manager template by referencing the key vault that contains the certificate keys. We recommend that you place the key-vault values in a Resource Manager template parameters file. Doing so keeps the Resource Manager template file reusable and free of values specific to a deployment.

#### Add all certificates to the virtual machine scale set osProfile
Every certificate that's installed in the cluster must be configured in the osProfile section of the scale set resource (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets). This action instructs the resource provider to install the certificate on the VMs. This installation includes both the cluster certificate and any application security certificates that you plan to use for your applications:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  ...
  "properties": {
    ...
    "osProfile": {
      ...
      "secrets": [
        {
          "sourceVault": {
            "id": "[parameters('sourceVaultValue')]"
          },
          "vaultCertificates": [
            {
              "certificateStore": "[parameters('clusterCertificateStorevalue')]",
              "certificateUrl": "[parameters('clusterCertificateUrlValue')]"
            },
            {
              "certificateStore": "[parameters('applicationCertificateStorevalue')",
              "certificateUrl": "[parameters('applicationCertificateUrlValue')]"
            },
            ...
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Configure the Service Fabric cluster certificate
The cluster authentication certificate must be configured in both the Service Fabric cluster resource (Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters) and the Service Fabric extension for virtual machine scale sets in the virtual machine scale set resource. This arrangement allows the Service Fabric resource provider to configure it for use for cluster authentication and server authentication for management endpoints.

##### Virtual machine scale set resource:
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets",
  ...
  "properties": {
    ...
    "virtualMachineProfile": {
      "extensionProfile": {
        "extensions": [
          {
            "name": "[concat('ServiceFabricNodeVmExt','_vmNodeType0Name')]",
            "properties": {
              ...
              "settings": {
                ...
                "certificate": {
                  "thumbprint": "[parameters('clusterCertificateThumbprint')]",
                  "x509StoreName": "[parameters('clusterCertificateStoreValue')]"
                },
                ...
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Service Fabric resource:
```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2016-03-01",
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters",
  "name": "[parameters('clusterName')]",
  "location": "[parameters('clusterLocation')]",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('supportLogStorageAccountName'))]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "certificate": {
      "thumbprint": "[parameters('clusterCertificateThumbprint')]",
      "x509StoreName": "[parameters('clusterCertificateStoreValue')]"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### Insert Azure AD configuration
The Azure AD configuration that you created earlier can be inserted directly into your Resource Manager template. However, we recommended that you first extract the values into a parameters file to keep the Resource Manager template reusable and free of values specific to a deployment.

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "2016-03-01",
  "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters",
  "name": "[parameters('clusterName')]",
  ...
  "properties": {
    "certificate": {
      "thumbprint": "[parameters('clusterCertificateThumbprint')]",
      "x509StoreName": "[parameters('clusterCertificateStorevalue')]"
    },
    ...
    "azureActiveDirectory": {
      "tenantId": "[parameters('aadTenantId')]",
      "clusterApplication": "[parameters('aadClusterApplicationId')]",
      "clientApplication": "[parameters('aadClientApplicationId')]"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

### Configure Resource Manager template parameters
Finally, use the output values from the key vault and Azure AD PowerShell commands to populate the parameters file:

```json
{
    "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        ...
        "clusterCertificateStoreValue": {
            "value": "My"
        },
        "clusterCertificateThumbprint": {
            "value": "<thumbprint>"
        },
        "clusterCertificateUrlValue": {
            "value": "https://myvault.vault.azure.net:443/secrets/myclustercert/4d087088df974e869f1c0978cb100e47"
        },
        "applicationCertificateStorevalue": {
            "value": "My"
        },
        "applicationCertificateUrlValue": {
            "value": "https://myvault.vault.azure.net:443/secrets/myapplicationcert/2e035058ae274f869c4d0348ca100f08"
        },
        "sourceVaultvalue": {
            "value": "/subscriptions/<guid>/resourceGroups/mycluster-keyvault/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/myvault"
        },
        "aadTenantId": {
            "value": "<guid>"
        },
        "aadClusterApplicationId": {
            "value": "<guid>"
        },
        "aadClientApplicationId": {
            "value": "<guid>"
        },
        ...
    }
}
```
At this point, you should have the following elements in place:

* Key vault resource group
  * Key vault
  * Cluster server authentication certificate
  * Data encipherment certificate
* Azure Active Directory tenant
  * Azure AD application for web-based management and Service Fabric Explorer
  * Azure AD application for native client management
  * Users and their assigned roles
* Service Fabric cluster Resource Manager template
  * Certificates configured through key vault
  * Azure Active Directory configured

The following diagram illustrates where your key vault and Azure AD configuration fit into your Resource Manager template.

![Resource Manager dependency map][cluster-security-arm-dependency-map]

## Create the cluster
You are now ready to create the cluster by using [Azure resource template deployment][resource-group-template-deploy].

#### Test it
Use the following PowerShell command to test your Resource Manager template with a parameters file:

```powershell
Test-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile .\azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

#### Deploy it
If the Resource Manager template test passes, use the following PowerShell command to deploy your Resource Manager template with a parameters file:

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "myresourcegroup" -TemplateFile .\azuredeploy.json -TemplateParameterFile .\azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

## Assign users to roles
After you have created the applications to represent your cluster, assign your users to the roles supported by Service Fabric: read-only and admin. You can assign the roles by using the [Azure classic portal][azure-classic-portal].

1. In the Azure portal, go to your tenant, and then select **Applications**.
2. Select the web application, which has a name like `myTestCluster_Cluster`.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. Select a user to assign, and then click the **Assign** button at the bottom of the screen.

    ![Assign users to roles button][assign-users-to-roles-button]
5. Select the role to assign to the user.

    !["Assign Users" dialog box][assign-users-to-roles-dialog]

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about roles in Service Fabric, see [Role-based access control for Service Fabric clients](service-fabric-cluster-security-roles.md).

## Create secure clusters on Linux
To make the process easier, we have provided a [helper script](http://github.com/ChackDan/Service-Fabric/tree/master/Scripts/CertUpload4Linux). Before you use this helper script, ensure that you already have Azure command-line interface (CLI) installed, and it is in your path. Make sure that the script has permissions to execute by running `chmod +x cert_helper.py` after downloading it. The first step is to sign in to your Azure account by using CLI with the `azure login` command. After signing in to your Azure account, use the helper script with your CA signed certificate, as the following command shows:

```sh
./cert_helper.py [-h] CERT_TYPE [-ifile INPUT_CERT_FILE] [-sub SUBSCRIPTION_ID] [-rgname RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [-kv KEY_VAULT_NAME] [-sname CERTIFICATE_NAME] [-l LOCATION] [-p PASSWORD]
```

The -ifile parameter can take a .pfx file or a .pem file as input, with the certificate type (pfx or pem, or ss if it is a self-signed certificate).
The parameter -h prints out the help text.


This command returns the following three strings as the output:

* SourceVaultID, which is the ID for the new KeyVault ResourceGroup it created for you
* CertificateUrl for accessing the certificate
* CertificateThumbprint, which is used for authentication

The following example shows how to use the command:

```sh
./cert_helper.py pfx -sub "fffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"  -rgname "mykvrg" -kv "mykevname" -ifile "/home/test/cert.pfx" -sname "mycert" -l "East US" -p "pfxtest"
```
Executing the preceding command gives you the three strings as follows:

```sh
SourceVault: /subscriptions/fffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff/resourceGroups/mykvrg/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/mykvname
CertificateUrl: https://myvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mycert/00000000000000000000000000000000
CertificateThumbprint: 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
```

The certificate's subject name must match the domain that you use to access the Service Fabric cluster. This match is required to provide an SSL for the cluster's HTTPS management endpoints and Service Fabric Explorer. You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a CA for the `.cloudapp.azure.com` domain. You must obtain a custom domain name for your cluster. When you request a certificate from a CA, the certificate's subject name must match the custom domain name that you use for your cluster.

These subject names are the entries you need to create a secure Service Fabric cluster (without Azure AD), as described at [Configure Resource Manager template parameters](#Configure-Resource-Manager-template-parameters). You can connect to the secure cluster by following the instructions for [authenticating client access to a cluster](service-fabric-connect-to-secure-cluster.md). Linux clusters do not support Azure AD authentication. You can assign admin and client roles as described in the [Assign roles to users](#Assign-users-to-roles) section. When you specify admin and client roles for a Linux cluster, you have to provide certificate thumbprints for authentication. You do not provide the subject name, because no chain validation or revocation is being performed.

If you want to use a self-signed certificate for testing, you can use the same script to generate one. You can then upload the certificate to your key vault by providing the flag `ss` instead of providing the certificate path and certificate name. For example, see the following command for creating and uploading a self-signed certificate:

```sh
./cert_helper.py ss -rgname "mykvrg" -sub "fffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff" -kv "mykevname"   -sname "mycert" -l "East US" -p "selftest" -subj "mytest.eastus.cloudapp.net"
```
This command returns the same three strings: SourceVault, CertificateUrl, and CertificateThumbprint. You can then use the strings to create both a secure Linux cluster and a location where the self-signed certificate is placed. You need the self-signed certificate to connect to the cluster. You can connect to the secure cluster by following the instructions for [authenticating client access to a cluster](service-fabric-connect-to-secure-cluster.md).

The certificate's subject name must match the domain that you use to access the Service Fabric cluster. This match is required to provide an SSL for the cluster's HTTPS management endpoints and Service Fabric Explorer. You cannot obtain an SSL certificate from a CA for the `.cloudapp.azure.com` domain. You must obtain a custom domain name for your cluster. When you request a certificate from a CA, the certificate's subject name must match the custom domain name that you use for your cluster.

You can fill the parameters from the helper script in the Azure portal, as described in the [Create a cluster in the Azure portal](service-fabric-cluster-creation-via-portal.md#create-cluster-in-the-azure-portal) section.

## Next steps
At this point, you have a secure cluster with Azure Active Directory providing management authentication. Next, [connect to your cluster](service-fabric-connect-to-secure-cluster.md) and learn how to [manage application secrets](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md).

## Troubleshoot setting up Azure Active Directory for client authentication
If you run into an issue while you're setting up Azure AD for client authentication, review the potential solutions in this section.

### Service Fabric Explorer prompts you to select a certificate
#### Problem
After you sign in successfully to Azure AD in Service Fabric Explorer, the browser returns to the home page but a message prompts you to select a certificate.

![SFX select certificate dialog][sfx-select-certificate-dialog]

#### Reason
The user isn’t assigned a role in the Azure AD cluster application. Thus, Azure AD authentication fails on Service Fabric cluster. Service Fabric Explorer falls back to certificate authentication.

#### Solution
Follow the instructions for setting up Azure AD, and assign user roles. Also, we recommend that you turn on “User assignment required to access app,” as `SetupApplications.ps1` does.

### Connection with PowerShell fails with an error: "The specified credentials are invalid"
#### Problem
When you use PowerShell to connect to the cluster by using “AzureActiveDirectory” security mode, after you sign in successfully to Azure AD, the connection fails with an error: "The specified credentials are invalid."

#### Solution
This solution is the same as the preceding one.

### Service Fabric Explorer returns a failure when you sign in: "AADSTS50011"
#### Problem
When you try to sign in to Azure AD in Service Fabric Explorer, the page returns a failure: "AADSTS50011: The reply address &lt;url&gt; does not match the reply addresses configured for the application: &lt;guid&gt;."

![SFX reply address does not match][sfx-reply-address-not-match]

#### Reason
The cluster (web) application that represents Service Fabric Explorer attempts to authenticate against Azure AD, and as part of the request it provides the redirect return URL. But the URL is not listed in the Azure AD application **REPLY URL** list.

#### Solution
On the **Configure** tab of the cluster (web) application, add the URL of Service Fabric Explorer to the **REPLY URL** list or replace one of the items in the list. When you have finished, save your change.

![Web application reply url][web-application-reply-url]

### Connect the cluster by using Azure AD authentication via PowerShell
To connect the Service Fabric cluster, use the following PowerShell command example:

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint <endpoint> -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 -AzureActiveDirectory -ServerCertThumbprint <thumbprint>
```

To learn about the Connect-ServiceFabricCluster cmdlet, see [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt125938.aspx).

### Can I reuse the same Azure AD tenant in multiple clusters?
Yes. But remember to add the URL of Service Fabric Explorer to your cluster (web) application. Otherwise, Service Fabric Explorer doesn’t work.

### Why do I still need a server certificate while Azure AD is enabled?
FabricClient and FabricGateway perform a mutual authentication. During Azure AD authentication, Azure AD integration provides a client identity to the server, and the server certificate is used to verify the server identity. For more information about Service Fabric certificates, see [X.509 certificates and Service Fabric][x509-certificates-and-service-fabric].
