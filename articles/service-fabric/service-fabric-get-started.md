# Prepare your development environment on Windows

 To build and run [Azure Service Fabric applications][1] on your Windows development machine, install the runtime, SDK, and tools. You also need to enable execution of the Windows PowerShell scripts included in the SDK.

## Prerequisites
### Supported operating system versions
The following operating system versions are supported for development:

* Windows 7
* Windows 8/Windows 8.1
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows 10

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 7 only includes Windows PowerShell 2.0 by default. Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets requires PowerShell 3.0 or higher. You can [download Windows PowerShell 5.0][powershell5-download] from the Microsoft Download Center.
> 
> 

## Install the SDK and tools
### To use Visual Studio 2017
Service Fabric Tools are part of the Azure Development and Management workload in Visual Studio 2017. Enable this workload as part of your Visual Studio installation.
In addition, you need to install the Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK, using Web Platform Installer.

* [Install the Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK][core-sdk]

### To use Visual Studio 2015 (requires Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 or later)
For Visual Studio 2015, Service Fabric tools are installed together with the SDK, using the Web Platform Installer:

* [Install the Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK and Tools][full-bundle-vs2015]

### SDK installation only
If you only need the SDK, you can install this package:
* [Install the Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK][core-sdk]

The current versions are:
* Service Fabric SDK 2.8.219
* Service Fabric runtime 6.0.219
* Service Fabric Tools for Visual Studio 2015 1.8.50927.3
* Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 includes Service Fabric Tools for Visual Studio 1.7.20170817
* Visual Studio 2017 Update 4 Preview 1 (15.4.0 Preview 1.0) includes Service Fabric Tools for Visual Studio 1.7.20170721

For a list of supported versions, see [Service Fabric support](service-fabric-support.md)

## Enable PowerShell script execution
Service Fabric uses Windows PowerShell scripts for creating a local development cluster and for deploying applications from Visual Studio. By default, Windows blocks these scripts from running. To enable them, you must modify your PowerShell execution policy. Open PowerShell as an administrator and enter the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Next steps
Now that you've finished setting up your development environment, start building and running apps.
