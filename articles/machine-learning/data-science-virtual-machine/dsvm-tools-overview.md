# Get to know your Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science Virtual Machine (**DSVM**) includes an extensive list of popular Data Science, Machine Learning / AI Tools, and Data Platforms. These have been set up in configurations that are rigorously tested by Data Scientists and Developers at Microsoft, as well as by the broader Data Science community to ensure stability and general viability.

The DSVM also includes multiple code samples and walkthroughs in the form of Jupyter notebooks that can be executed locally. There is also documentation for these samples to aid comprehension. 

The tools, platforms, utilities and samples included in the DSVM have been organized into the following sections:

1. **[Deep Learning & AI Frameworks](dsvm-deep-learning-ai-frameworks.md)**
2. **[ML & Data Science Tools](dsvm-ml-data-science-tools.md)**
3. **[Programming Languages](dsvm-languages.md)**
4. **[Development Tools & IDEs](dsvm-tools-development.md)**
5. **[Data Ingestion Tools](dsvm-tools-ingestion.md)**
6. **[Data Exploration & Visualization Tools](dsvm-tools-explore-and-visualize.md)**
7. **[Data Platforms](dsvm-data-platforms.md)**
8. **[Samples and Walkthroughs](dsvm-samples-and-walkthroughs.md)**
