# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a Node.js application by using Graph API

Azure Cosmos DB is the globally distributed multimodel database service from Microsoft. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This Quick Start article demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account for Graph API (preview), database, and graph by using the Azure portal. You then build and run a console app by using the open-source [Gremlin Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gremlin) driver.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version v0.10.29 or later
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-graph](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-graph.md)]

## Add a graph

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-graph](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-graph.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a Graph API app from GitHub, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a Git terminal window, such as Git Bash, and change (via `cd` command) to a working directory.

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-graph-nodejs-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the `app.js` file, and you see the following lines of code. 

* The Gremlin client is created.

    ```nodejs
    const client = Gremlin.createClient(
        443, 
        config.endpoint, 
        { 
            "session": false, 
            "ssl": true, 
            "user": `/dbs/${config.database}/colls/${config.collection}`,
            "password": config.primaryKey
        });
    ```

  The configurations are all in `config.js`, which we edit in the [following section](#update-your-connection-string).

* A series of functions are defined to execute different Gremlin operations. This is one of them:

    ```nodejs
    function addVertex1(callback)
    {
        console.log('Running Add Vertex1'); 
        client.execute("g.addV('person').property('id', 'thomas').property('firstName', 'Thomas').property('age', 44).property('userid', 1)", { }, (err, results) => {
          if (err) callback(console.error(err));
          console.log("Result: %s\n", JSON.stringify(results));
          callback(null)
        });
    }
    ```

* Each function executes a `client.execute` method with a Gremlin query string parameter. Here is an example of how `g.V().count()` is executed:

    ```nodejs
    console.log('Running Count'); 
    client.execute("g.V().count()", { }, (err, results) => {
        if (err) return console.error(err);
        console.log(JSON.stringify(results));
        console.log();
    });
    ```

* At the end of the file, all methods are then invoked using the `async.waterfall()` method. This will execute them one after the other:

    ```nodejs
    try{
        async.waterfall([
            dropGraph,
            addVertex1,
            addVertex2,
            addEdge,
            countVertices
            ], finish);
    } catch(err) {
        console.log(err)
    }
    ```


## Update your connection string

1. Open the config.js file. 

2. In config.js, fill in the `config.endpoint` key with the **Gremlin URI** value from the **Overview** page of the Azure portal. 

    `config.endpoint = "GRAPHENDPOINT";`

    ![View and copy an access key in the Azure portal, Keys blade](./media/create-graph-nodejs/gremlin-uri.png)

   If the **Gremlin URI** value is blank, you can generate the value from the **Keys** page in the portal. Use the **URI** value, remove https://, and change documents to graphs.

   The Gremlin endpoint must be only the host name without the protocol/port number, like `mygraphdb.graphs.azure.com` (not `https://mygraphdb.graphs.azure.com` or `mygraphdb.graphs.azure.com:433`).

3. In config.js, fill in the config.primaryKey value with the **Primary Key** value from the **Keys** page of the Azure portal. 

    `config.primaryKey = "PRIMARYKEY";`

   ![Azure portal "Keys" blade](./media/create-graph-nodejs/keys.png)

4. Enter the database name, and graph (container) name for the value of config.database and config.collection. 

Here's an example of what your completed config.js file should look like:

```nodejs
var config = {}

// Note that this must not have HTTPS or the port number
config.endpoint = "testgraphacct.graphs.azure.com";
config.primaryKey = "Pams6e7LEUS7LJ2Qk0fjZf3eGo65JdMWHmyn65i52w8ozPX2oxY3iP0yu05t9v1WymAHNcMwPIqNAEv3XDFsEg==";
config.database = "graphdb"
config.collection = "Persons"

module.exports = config;
```

## Run the console app

1. Open a terminal window and change (via `cd` command) to the installation directory for the package.json file that's included in the project.

2. Run `npm install` to install the required npm modules, including `gremlin`.

3. Run `node app.js` in a terminal to start your node application.

## Browse with Data Explorer

You can now go back to Data Explorer in the Azure portal to view, query, modify, and work with your new graph data.

In Data Explorer, the new database appears in the **Graphs** pane. Expand the database, followed by the collection, and then select **Graph**.

The data generated by the sample app is displayed in the next pane within the **Graph** tab when you select **Apply Filter**.

Try completing `g.V()` with `.has('firstName', 'Thomas')` to test the filter. Note that the value is case sensitive.

## Clean up your resources

If you do not plan to continue using this app, delete all resources that you created in this article by doing the following: 

1. In the Azure portal, on the left navigation menu, select **Resource groups**. Then select the name of the resource that you created. 

2. On your resource group page, select **Delete**. Type the name of the resource to be deleted, and then select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this article, you learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a graph by using Data Explorer, and run an app. You can now build more complex queries and implement powerful graph traversal logic by using Gremlin.
