# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a MongoDB API web app with .NET and the Azure portal

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, document database, and collection using the Azure portal. You'll then build and deploy a tasks list web app built on the [MongoDB .NET driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/csharp/). 

## Prerequisites

If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)] 
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-mongodb](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-mongodb.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount-mongodb.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a MongoDB API app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `cd` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-dotnet-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the **Dal.cs** file under the **DAL** directory and you'll find that these lines of code create the Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

* Initialize the Mongo Client.

    ```cs
        MongoClientSettings settings = new MongoClientSettings();
        settings.Server = new MongoServerAddress(host, 10255);
        settings.UseSsl = true;
        settings.SslSettings = new SslSettings();
        settings.SslSettings.EnabledSslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12;

        MongoIdentity identity = new MongoInternalIdentity(dbName, userName);
        MongoIdentityEvidence evidence = new PasswordEvidence(password);

        settings.Credentials = new List<MongoCredential>()
        {
            new MongoCredential("SCRAM-SHA-1", identity, evidence)
        };

        MongoClient client = new MongoClient(settings);
    ```

* Retrieve the database and the collection.

    ```cs
    private string dbName = "Tasks";
    private string collectionName = "TasksList";

    var database = client.GetDatabase(dbName);
    var todoTaskCollection = database.GetCollection<MyTask>(collectionName);
    ```

* Retrieve all documents.

    ```cs
    collection.Find(new BsonDocument()).ToList();
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in your Azure Cosmos DB account, in the left navigation click **Connection String**, and then click **Read-write Keys**. You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the Username, Password, and Host into the Dal.cs file in the next step.

2. Open the **Dal.cs** file in the **DAL** directory. 

3. Copy your **username** value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the **username** in your **Dal.cs** file. 

4. Then copy your **host** value from the portal and make it the value of the **host** in your **Dal.cs** file. 

5. Finally copy your **password** value from the portal and make it the value of the **password** in your **Dal.cs** file. 

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 
    
## Run the web app

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**. 

2. In the NuGet **Browse** box, type *MongoDB.Driver*.

3. From the results, install the **MongoDB.Driver** library. This installs the MongoDB.Driver package as well as all dependencies.

4. Click CTRL + F5 to run the application. Your app displays in your browser. 

5. Click **Create** in the browser and create a few new tasks in your task list app.

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account and run a web app using the API for MongoDB. You can now import additional data to your Cosmos DB account.
