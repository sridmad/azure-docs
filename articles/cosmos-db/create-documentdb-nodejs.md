# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a DocumentDB API app with Node.js and the Azure portal

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, document database, and collection using the Azure portal. You then build and run a console app built on the [DocumentDB Node.js API](documentdb-sdk-node.md).

## Prerequisites

* Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
	* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version v0.10.29 or higher
	* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)] 
[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api](../../includes/cosmos-db-emulator-docdb-api.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-dbaccount](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-dbaccount.md)]

## Add a collection

[!INCLUDE [cosmos-db-create-collection](../../includes/cosmos-db-create-collection.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a DocumentDB API app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `CD` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-documentdb-nodejs-getting-started.git
    ```

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the `app.js` file and you find that these lines of code create the Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

* The `documentClient` is initialized.

    ```nodejs
    var client = new documentClient(config.endpoint, { "masterKey": config.primaryKey });
    ```

* A new database is created.

    ```nodejs
    client.createDatabase(config.database, (err, created) => {
        if (err) reject(err)
        else resolve(created);
    });
    ```

* A new collection is created.

    ```nodejs
    client.createCollection(databaseUrl, config.collection, { offerThroughput: 400 }, (err, created) => {
        if (err) reject(err)
        else resolve(created);
    });
    ```

* Some documents are created.

    ```nodejs
    client.createDocument(collectionUrl, document, (err, created) => {
        if (err) reject(err)
        else resolve(created);
    });
    ```

* A SQL query over JSON is performed.

    ```nodejs
    client.queryDocuments(
        collectionUrl,
        'SELECT VALUE r.children FROM root r WHERE r.lastName = "Andersen"'
    ).toArray((err, results) => {
        if (err) reject(err)
        else {
            for (var queryResult of results) {
                let resultString = JSON.stringify(queryResult);
                console.log(`\tQuery returned ${resultString}`);
            }
            console.log();
            resolve(results);
        }
    });
    ```    

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in your Azure Cosmos DB account, in the left navigation click **Keys**, and then click **Read-write Keys**. You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the URI and Primary Key into the `config.js` file in the next step.

    ![View and copy an access key in the Azure portal, Keys blade](./media/create-documentdb-dotnet/keys.png)

2. In Open the `config.js` file. 

3. Copy your URI value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the endpoint key in `config.js`. 

    `config.endpoint = "https://FILLME.documents.azure.com"`

4. Then copy your PRIMARY KEY value from the portal and make it the value of the `config.primaryKey` in `config.js`. You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

    `config.primaryKey "FILLME"`
    
## Run the app
1. Run `npm install` in a terminal to install required npm modules

2. Run `node app.js` in a terminal to start your node application.

You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data. 

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a collection using the Data Explorer, and run an app. You can now import additional data to your Cosmos DB account.
