## Release and Retirement dates
Microsoft provides notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is recommended that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible. 

Any requests to Azure Cosmos DB using a retired SDK are rejected by the service.

## Troubleshooting

If you get the error 

```
Unable to resolve dependency 'Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Common'. Source(s) used: 'nuget.org', 
'CliFallbackFolder', 'Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages', 'Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK'`
```

when attempting to use the Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table NuGet package, you have two options to fix the issue:

* Use Package Manage Console to install the Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table package and its dependencies. To do this, type the following in the Package Manager Console for your solution. 
    ```
    Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table -IncludePrerelease
    ```
    
* Using your preferred Nuget package management tool, install the Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Common Nuget package before installing Microsoft.Azure.CosmosDB.Table.
