### Additional information

#### .NET
The .NET ecosystem has multiple runtimes, hence there are multiple .NET libraries for Event Hubs. The .NET Standard library can be run using either .NET Core or the .NET Framework, while the .NET Framework library can only be run in a .NET Framework environment. For more information on .NET Frameworks, see [framework versions](/dotnet/articles/standard/frameworks#framework-versions).
