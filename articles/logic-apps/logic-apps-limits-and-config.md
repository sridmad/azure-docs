# Logic Apps limits and configuration

This topic describes the current limits and configuration details for Azure Logic Apps.

## Limits

### HTTP request limits

These limits apply to a single HTTP request or a connector call.

#### Timeout

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Request timeout | 120 seconds | An [async pattern](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md) or [until loop](logic-apps-loops-and-scopes.md) can compensate as needed |
|||| 

#### Message size

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Message size | 100 MB | Some connectors and APIs might not support 100 MB. | 
| Expression evaluation limit | 131,072 characters | `@concat()`, `@base64()`, `string` can't be longer than this limit. | 
|||| 

#### Retry policy

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Retry attempts | 90 | The default is 4. You can configure with the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). | 
| Retry max delay | 1 day | You can configure with the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). | 
| Retry min delay | 5 sec | You can configure with the [retry policy parameter](../logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers.md). |
|||| 

### Run duration and retention

These limits apply to a single logic app run.

| Name | Limit | 
| ---- | ----- | 
| Run duration | 90 days | 
| Storage retention | 90 days from the run's start time | 
| Min recurrence interval | 1 second </br>For logic apps with an App Service Plan: 15 seconds | 
| Max recurrence interval | 500 days | 
||| 

To exceed the limits for run duration or 
storage retention in your normal processing flow, 
[contact us](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) 
so that we can help with your requirements.

### Looping and debatching limits

These limits apply to a single logic app run.

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| ForEach items | 100,000 | You can use the [query action](../connectors/connectors-native-query.md) to filter larger arrays as needed. | 
| Until iterations | 5,000 | | 
| SplitOn items | 100,000 | | 
| ForEach Parallelism | 50 | The default is 20. <p>To set a specific level of parallelism in a ForEach loop, set the `runtimeConfiguration` property in the `foreach` action. <p>To sequentially run a ForEach loop, set the `operationOptions` property to "Sequential" in the `foreach` action. | 
|||| 

### Throughput limits

These limits apply to a single logic app instance.

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Actions executions per 5 minutes | 100,000 | Can distribute workload across multiple apps as needed. | 
| Actions concurrent outgoing calls | ~2,500 | Decrease number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Concurrent incoming calls | ~1,000 | Decrease number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Read calls per 5 minutes | 60,000 | Can distribute workload across multiple apps as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 45,000 | Can distribute workload across multiple apps as needed. | 
|||| 

To exceed these limits in normal processing, 
or run load testing that might exceed these limits, 
[contact us](mailto://logicappsemail@microsoft.com) 
so that we can help with your requirements.

### Logic app definition limits

These limits apply to a single logic app definition.

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Actions per workflow | 500 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. |
| Allowed action nesting depth | 8 | To extend this limit, you can add nested workflows as needed. | 
| Workflows per region per subscription | 1000 | | 
| Triggers per workflow | 10 | | 
| Switch scope cases limit | 25 | | 
| Number of variables per workflow | 250 | | 
| Max characters per expression | 8,192 | | 
| Max `trackedProperties` size in characters | 16,000 | 
| `action`/`trigger` name limit | 80 | | 
| `description` length limit | 256 | | 
| `parameters` limit | 50 | | 
| `outputs` limit | 10 | | 
||||

### Custom connector limits

These limits apply to custom connectors that you can create from web APIs.

| Name | Limit | 
| ---- | ----- | 
| Number of custom connectors that you can create | 1,000 per Azure subscription | 
| Number of requests per minute for each connection created by a custom connector | 500 requests for each connection created by the connector |
||| 

### Integration account limits

These limits apply to artifacts that you can add to an integration account.

| Name | Limit | Notes | 
| ---- | ----- | ----- | 
| Schema | 8 MB | You can use [blob URI](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to upload files larger than 2 MB. | 
| Map (XSLT file) | 2 MB | | 
| Runtime endpoint: Read calls per 5 minutes | 60,000 | Can distribute the workload across multiple accounts as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Invoke calls per 5 minutes | 45,000 | Can distribute the workload across multiple accounts as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Tracking calls per 5 minutes | 45,000 | Can distribute the workload across multiple accounts as needed. | 
| Runtime endpoint: Blocking concurrent calls | ~1,000 | Decrease the number of concurrent requests or reduce the duration as needed. | 
|||| 

These limits apply to the number of artifacts that you can add to an integration account.

#### Free pricing tier

| Name | Limit | Notes |

## Configuration: IP Addresses

### Logic Apps service

The calls that a logic app directly makes, that is, through 
[HTTP](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md) or 
[HTTP + Swagger](../connectors/connectors-native-http-swagger.md) 
or other HTTP requests, come from IP addresses in this list.
