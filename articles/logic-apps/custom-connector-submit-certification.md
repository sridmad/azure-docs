# Submit your connectors for Microsoft certification

To make custom connectors publicly available for all users 
in Azure Logic Apps, Microsoft Flow, and Microsoft PowerApps, 
submit your connector to Microsoft for review, validation, 
and approval for publishing. 

## Certification criteria

| Capability | Details | Required or Recommended |
|------------|---------|-------------------------|
| Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) app | Meets a user scenario that fits well with Logic Apps, Flow, and PowerApps. | Required |
| Authentication type | Your API must support OAuth2, API Key, or Basic Authentication. | Required | 
| Support | You must provide a support contact so that customers can get help. | Required | 
| Availability and uptime | Your app has at least 99.9% uptime. | Recommended | 
|||| 

Also, if you're not a Microsoft partner or Independent Software Vendor (ISV), 
and you want to certify and publicly release a connector, 
you must either own the underlying service or present explicit 
rights to use the API.

## Validation phases

Microsoft uses these validation phases 
for evaluating your connector:

| Validation phase | Description | 
| ----- | ----------- |
| Functionality | Microsoft tests your connector with Logic Apps, Flow, and PowerApps for these errors: <p>- Invalid OpenAPI (Swagger) or JSON errors that appear in the Definition section from the custom connector wizard <p>- Runtime and schema validation errors that appear in the Test section from the custom connector wizard | 
| Content | Microsoft checks that your connector uses friendly names and descriptions for each entity. Make sure that each operation, input parameter, and response attribute in your connector's Swagger has these elements: <p>- [Summary](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md#summary) <br>- [Description](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md#description) </br>- [Visibility information](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md#visibility) |

## Nominate and submit your connector to Microsoft for certification

To apply for certification, follow these steps:

1. **Nominate**

   1. [Submit your nomination](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848754).

      1. At the bottom of the page, choose **Contact us**.
      2. Fill the form, and select **Questions on ISV connector program and co-marketing**.
      3. Choose **Submit**.

   2. Sign the mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement and Partner Agreement that you receive. 

      Microsoft requires these signed contracts before proceeding. 
      We can then check whether your connector meets the certification criteria. 
   
   3. If your connector is approved, Microsoft notifies you 
   with instructions for onboarding.
    
2. **Review**

   1. Send this information to your nomination contact for review:

      * The OpenAPI file that describes your API
	  * The icon file (.png or .jpg) that represents your connector 
      
        Your icon should have a ~160 pixel logo inside a 230 pixel square. 
        A white logo on a colored background is preferred.
	  
      * Your icon's brand color in hexadecimal format, 
      which should match the colored background in the icon file

	  * A test account for validation
      * A support contact

   2. If we need more information, 
   we will contact you.

3. **Publish**

    After we validate your connector's functionality and content, 
    we stage the connector for deployment across all products and regions.
    
    By default, all connectors are published as "premium" connectors. 
    If you built your app with Azure, you can apply for 
    listing your connector as a "standard" connector that's 
    available to all users with Office 365 Enterprise plans. 
    For more details, ask your nomination contact.
