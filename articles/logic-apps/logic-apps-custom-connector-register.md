# Register custom connectors in Azure Logic Apps

After you build your REST API, set up authentication, 
and get your OpenAPI definition file or a Postman collection, 
you're ready to register your connector. 

## Prerequisites

To register your custom connector, you need these items:

* Details for registering your connector in Azure, 
such as the name, Azure subscription, Azure resource group, 
and location that you want to use

* An OpenAPI (Swagger) file or a Postman collection that describes your API

  For this tutorial, you can use the 
  [sample Azure Resources Manager OpenAPI file](http://pwrappssamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/AzureResourceManager.json).

* An icon that represents your connector

* A short description for your connector

* The host location for your API

## 1. Create your connector

1. In the Azure portal, on the main Azure menu, choose **New**. 
In the search box, enter "logic apps connector" as your filter, 
and press Enter.

   ![New, search for "logic apps connector"](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/create-logic-apps-connector.png)

2. From the results list, choose **Logic Apps Connector** > **Create**.

   ![Create Logic Apps connector](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/choose-logic-apps-connector.png)

3. Provide details for registering your connector 
as described in the table. When you're done, 
choose **Pin to dashboard** > **Create**.

   ![Logic App custom connector details](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/logic-apps-connector-details.png)

   | Property | Suggested value | Description | 
   | -------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Name** | *custom-connector-name* | Provide a name for your connector. | 
   | **Subscription** | *Azure-subscription-name* | Select your Azure subscription. | 
   | **Resource group** | *Azure-resource-group-name* | Create or select an Azure group for organizing your Azure resources. | 
   | **Location** | *deployment-region* | Select a deployment region for your connector. | 
   |||| 

   After Azure deploys your connector, 
   the custom connector menu opens automatically. 
   If not, choose your custom connector from the Azure dashboard.

## 2. Define your connector

Now specify the OpenAPI file or Postman collection for creating your connector, 
the authentication that your connector uses, 
the actions and triggers that your custom connector provides, 
and parameters that actions and triggers can use.

### 2a. Specify the OpenAPI file or Postman collection for your connector

1. In your connector's menu, if not already selected, 
choose **Logic Apps Connector**. In the toolbar, choose **Edit**.

   ![Edit custom connector](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/edit-custom-connector.png)

2. Choose **General** so that you can provide the details 
in these tables for creating, securing, and defining the 
actions and triggers for your custom connector.

   1. For **Custom connectors**, select an option 
   so you can provide the OpenAPI (Swagger) file that describes your API.

      ![Provide the OpenAPI file for your API](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/provide-openapi-file.png)

      | Option | Format |Description | 
      | ------ | ------ | ----------- | 
      | **Upload an OpenAPI file** | *OpenAPI (Swagger)-json-file* | Browse to the location for your OpenAPI file, and select that file. | 
      | **Use an OpenAPI URL** | http://*path-to-swagger-json-file* | Provide the URL for your API's OpenAPI file. | 
      | **Upload Postman collection V1** | *exported-Postman-collection-V1-file* | Browse to the location for an exported Postman collection in V1 format. | 
      |||| 

   2. For **General information**, upload an icon for your connector. 
   Typically, the **Description**, **Host**, and **Base URL** fields 
   are automatically populated from your OpenAPI file. 
   But if they're not, add this information as described in the table, 
   and choose **Continue**. 

      ![Connector details](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/add-connector-details.png)

      | Option or setting | Format | Description | 
      | ----------------- | ------ | ----------- | 
      | **Upload Icon** | *png-or-jpg-file-under-1-MB* | An icon that represents your connector <p>Color: Preferably a white logo against a color background. <p>Dimensions: A ~160 pixel logo inside a 230 pixel square | 
      | **Icon background color** | *icon-brand-color-hexadecimal-code* | <p>The color behind your icon that matches the background color in your icon file. <p>Format: Hexadecimal. For example, #007ee5 represents the color blue. | 
      | **Description** | *connector-description* | Provide a short description for your connector. | 
      | **Host** | *connector-host* | Provide the host domain for your Web API. | 
      | **Base URL** | *connector-base-URL* | Provide the base URL for your Web API. | 
      |||| 

### 2b. Describe the authentication that your connector uses

1. Now choose **Security** so you can review or describe the authentication 
that your connector uses. Authentication makes sure that your users' 
identities flow appropriately between your service and any clients.

   ![Authentication type](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/security.png)

   * If you upload an OpenAPI file, the registration wizard 
   automatically detects the authentication type that your Web API uses, 
   and automatically populates the **Security** section in the wizard, 
   based on the `securityDefinitions` object in that file. For example, 
   here's a section that specifies using OAuth2.0:

     ``` json
     "securityDefinitions": {
       "AAD": {
       "type": "oauth2",
       "flow": "accessCode",
       "authorizationUrl": "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize",
       "tokenUrl": "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/token",
       "scopes": {}
       }
     },
     ```

   * If your OpenAPI file didn't populate the authentication type and properties, 
     choose **Edit** so you can add this information. 
   
     For example, if you previously [set up Azure AD authentication in this tutorial](../logic-apps/custom-connector-azure-active-directory-authentication.md), 
     you created Azure AD apps for securing your Web API and your connector. 
     So now you can provide the application ID and client key that you previously saved:
    
     | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
     | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
     | **Authentication type** | OAuth 2.0 | | 
     | **Identity Provider** | Azure Active Directory | | 
     | **Client id** | *application-ID-for-connector-Azure-AD-app* | The application ID that you previously saved for your connector's Azure AD app | 
     | **Client secret** | *client-key-for-connector-Azure-AD-app* | The client key for your connector's Azure AD app | 
     | **Login URL** | `https://login.windows.net` | | 
     | **Resource URL** | `https://management.core.windows.net/` | Make sure that you add the URL exactly as specified, including trailing slash. | 
     |||| 

   * A Postman collection, which automatically generates an OpenAPI file for you, 
   automatically populates the authentication type *only* when you 
   use the supported authentication types, such as OAuth 2.0 or Basic.

2. To save your connector after entering the security information, 
at the top of the page, choose **Update connector**, 
then choose **Continue**. 

### 2c. Review, update, or define actions and triggers for your connector

1. Now choose **Definition** so you can review, edit, 
or define new actions and triggers that users can add to their workflows.

   Actions and triggers are based on the operations defined in your OpenAPI file 
   or Postman collection, which automatically populate the **Definition** page 
   and include the request and response values. So, if the required operations 
   already appear here, you can go to the next step in the registration 
   process without making changes on this page.

   ![Connector definition](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/definition.png)

2. Optionally, if you want to edit existing actions and triggers, 
or add new ones, continue with these steps.

<a name="add-action-or-trigger"></a> 

#### Edit or add actions for your connector

1. To edit an existing action, choose the number for that action. 
To add an action that didn't exist in your OpenAPI file or Postman collection, 
under **Actions**, choose **New action**.

2. Under **General**, provide or edit this information for the action:
   
   | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Summary** | *operation-name* | The title for this action | 
   | **Description** | *operation-description* | The description for this action. <p>**Tip**: Make sure that your description ends with a period. |
   | **Operation ID** | *operation-identifier* | A unique name for identifying this action. Use camel case, for example: "GetPullRequest" | 
   |**Visibility**| **none**, **advanced**, **internal**, or **important** | The user-facing visibility for this action. For more information, see [OpenAPI extensions](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md#visibility). | 
   |||| 

3. Now define the request for the action.
  
   1. In the **Request** section, choose **Import from sample**. 

   2. On the **Import from sample** page, paste a sample request. 

      Usually, sample requests are available in the API documentation 
      where you can get information for the **Verb**, **URL**, 
      **Headers**, and **Body** fields. For example, see the 
      [Text Analytics API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c7).

      ![Import sample request](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/import-sample-operation-request.png)

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If you create a connector from a Postman collection, 
      > make sure you that you remove the `Content-type` header from actions and triggers. 
      > Logic Apps automatically adds this header. 
      > Also, remove authentication headers that you defined 
      > in the `Security` section from actions and triggers.

      For advanced OpenAPI functionality, 
      see [OpenAPI extensions for custom connectors](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md).

   3. To finish the request definition, choose **Import**.

4. Now define the response for the action.

   1. Under **Response**, you can specify a default response. 
   Choose **Add default response**.

   2. On the **Import from sample** page, paste a sample response, 
   then choose **Import**.

5. Finally, under **Validation**, 
review and fix any potential issues identified for the action.

#### Edit or add triggers for your connector

1. To edit an existing trigger, choose the number for that trigger. 
To add a trigger that didn't exist in your OpenAPI file or Postman collection, 
under **Triggers**, choose **New trigger**.

2. Under **General**, provide or edit this information for the trigger:

   | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Summary** | *operation-name* | The title for this trigger | 
   | **Description** | *operation-description* | The description for this trigger. <p>**Tip**: Make sure that your description ends with a period. | 
   | **Operation ID** | *operation-identifier* | A unique name for identifying this trigger. Use camel case, for example: "TriggerOnGitHubPushEvent" | 
   |**Visibility**| **none**, **advanced**, **internal**, or **important** | The user-facing visibility for this trigger. For more information, see [OpenAPI extensions](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md#visibility). | 
   | **Trigger type** | **Webhook** or **Polling** | The type for this trigger. For example, a webhook trigger waits for a specific event to happen before firing. A polling trigger regularly checks a service endpoint based on a specified interval and frequency. <p>For more information about webhook and polling trigger patterns, see [Create custom APIs](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md). | 
   |||| 

3. Now define the request that creates the trigger. 

   1. In the **Request** section, choose **Import from sample**.

   2. On the **Import from sample** page, paste a sample request. 

      Usually, sample requests are available in the API documentation 
      where you can get information for the **Verb**, **URL**, 
      **Headers**, and **Body** fields. For example, see the 
      [Text Analytics API documentation](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/TextAnalytics.V2.0/operations/56f30ceeeda5650db055a3c7).

      ![Import sample request](./media/logic-apps-custom-connector-register/import-sample-operation-request.png)

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > If you create a connector from a Postman collection, 
      > make sure you that you remove the `Content-type` header from actions and triggers. 
      > Logic Apps automatically adds this header. 
      > Also, remove authentication headers that you defined 
      > in the `Security` section from actions and triggers.

      For advanced OpenAPI functionality, 
      see [OpenAPI extensions for custom connectors](../logic-apps/custom-connector-openapi-extensions.md).

   3. To finish the request definition, choose **Import**. 

4. Now define the trigger's response. 
In the **Response** section, based on the trigger's type, 
follow these steps:

   **Webhook trigger**
   1. In **Webhook Response**, choose **Import from sample**. 

   2. On the **Import from sample** page, paste a sample response, 
   then choose **Import**. To view an example response, 
   see the [GitHub API reference for creating a webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-a-hook).

   3. Under **Trigger configuration**, select a parameter to use for the 
   webhook creation request. Logic Apps uses this parameter value for populating 
   the callback URL used by your service to communicate with the trigger.

   **Polling trigger**
   1. Under **Response**, you can specify a default response. 
   Choose **Add default response**.

   2. On the **Import from sample** page, paste a sample response, 
   then choose **Import**.

   3. Under **Trigger configuration**, specify the query parameter, 
   the value to pass for the parameter, and a *trigger hint* that 
   specifies a proper polling interval for the next request.

5. Finally, under **Validation**, 
review and fix any potential issues identified for the trigger.

#### Review reference definitions for your connector

The **References** section automatically populates from your API description 
and describes any parameter fields that actions and triggers can reference. 

1. Under **References**, choose the number for the 
reference definition that you want to review.

2. Under **Name**, review or update the reference definition name.

3. Under **Validation**, review and fix any potential 
issues identified for the reference definition.

## 3. Finish creating your connector

When you're ready, choose **Create** so you can deploy your connector. 
If you're updating an existing connector, choose **Update connector**.

Congratulations! Now when you create a logic app, 
you can find your connector in Logic Apps Designer, 
and add that connector to your logic app.

## Share your connector with other Logic Apps users

Registered but uncertified custom connectors work like 
Microsoft-managed connectors, but are visible and available 
*only* to the connector's author and users who have the same 
Azure Active Directory tenant and Azure subscription 
for logic apps in the region where those apps are deployed. 
Although sharing is optional, you might have scenarios where 
you want to share your connectors with other users. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you share a connector, others might start to depend on that connector. 
> ***Deleting your connector deletes all connections to that connector.***
 
To share your connector with external users outside these boundaries, 
for example, with all Logic Apps, Flow, and PowerApps users, 
[submit your connector for Microsoft certification](../logic-apps/custom-connector-submit-certification.md).

## FAQ

**Q:** Are there any limits for custom connectors? </br>
