# Create and register SOAP connectors in Azure Logic Apps

To integrate SOAP services in your logic app workflows, you can create and register a custom Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) connector by using Web Services Description Language (WSDL) that describes your SOAP service. The SOAP connectors work like prebuilt connectors, so you can use them in the same way as other connectors in your logic apps.


## Prerequisites

To register your SOAP connector, you need these items:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, 
you can start with a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
Otherwise, sign up for a [Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

* Any item here:
  * A URL to a WSDL that defines your SOAP service and the APIs
  * A WSDL file that defines your SOAP service and the APIs

  For this tutorial, you can use our example 
  [Orders SOAP Service](http://fazioapisoap.azurewebsites.net/FazioService.svc?singleWsdl).

* Optional: An image to use as an icon for your custom connector


## 1. Create your connector

1. In the Azure portal, on the main Azure menu, choose **New**. 
In the search box, enter "logic apps connector" as your filter, 
and press Enter.

   ![New, search for "logic apps connector"](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/create-logic-apps-connector.png)

2. From the results list, choose **Logic Apps Connector** > **Create**.

   ![Create Logic Apps connector](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/choose-logic-apps-connector.png)

3. Provide details for registering your connector 
as described in the table. When you're done, 
choose **Pin to dashboard** > **Create**.

   ![Logic App custom connector details](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/logic-apps-soap-connector-details.png)

   | Property | Suggested value | Description | 
   | -------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Name** | *soap-connector-name* | Provide a name for your connector. | 
   | **Subscription** | *Azure-subscription-name* | Select your Azure subscription. | 
   | **Resource group** | *Azure-resource-group-name* | Create or select an Azure group for organizing your Azure resources. | 
   | **Location** | *deployment-region* | Select a deployment region for your connector. | 
   |||| 

   After Azure deploys your connector, 
   the logic apps connector menu opens automatically. 
   If not, choose your soap connector from the Azure dashboard.

## 2. Define your connector

Now specify the WSDL file or URL for creating your connector, 
the authentication that your connector uses, 
and the actions and triggers that your soap connector provides


### 2a. Specify the WSDL file or URL for your connector

1. In your connector's menu, if not already selected, 
choose **Logic Apps Connector**. In the toolbar, choose **Edit**.

   ![Edit custom connector](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/edit-soap-connector.png)

2. Choose **General** so that you can provide the details 
in these tables for creating, securing, and defining the 
actions and triggers for your SOAP connector.

   1. For **Custom connectors**, select **SOAP** for your **API Endpoint** 
   so you can provide the WSDL file that describes your API.

      ![Provide the WSDL file for your API](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/provide-wsdl-file.png)

      | Option | Format |Description | 
      | ------ | ------ | ----------- | 
      | **Upload WSDL from file** | *WSDL-file* | Browse to the location for your WSDL file, and select that file. | 
      | **Upload WSDL from URL** | http://*path-to-wsdl-file* | Provide the URL for your service's WSDL file. | 
      | **SOAP to REST** |   | Transform APIs in SOAP service into REST APIs. | 
      |||| 

   2. For **General information**, upload an icon for your connector. 
   Typically, the **Description**, **Host**, and **Base URL** fields 
   are automatically populated from your WSDL file. 
   But if they're not, add this information as described in the table, 
   and choose **Continue**. 

      ![Connector details](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/add-general-details.png)

      | Option or setting | Format | Description | 
      | ----------------- | ------ | ----------- | 
      | **Upload Icon** | *png-or-jpg-file-under-1-MB* | An icon that represents your connector <p>Color: Preferably a white logo against a color background. <p>Dimensions: A ~160 pixel logo inside a 230 pixel square | 
      | **Icon background color** | *icon-brand-color-hexadecimal-code* | <p>The color behind your icon that matches the background color in your icon file. <p>Format: Hexadecimal. For example, #007ee5 represents the color blue. | 
      | **Description** | *connector-description* | Provide a short description for your connector. | 
      | **Host** | *connector-host* | Provide the host domain for your SOAP service. | 
      | **Base URL** | *connector-base-URL* | Provide the base URL for your SOAP service. | 
      |||| 

### 2b. Describe the authentication that your connector uses

1. Now choose **Security** so you can review or describe the authentication 
that your connector uses. Authentication makes sure that your users' 
identities flow appropriately between your service and any clients.

   By default, your connector's **Authentication type** is set to **No authentication**.
   
   ![Authentication type](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/security-authentication-options.png)

   To change the authentication type, choose **Edit**. You can select **Basic authentication**. To use parameter labels other than default values, update them under **Parameter label**.

   ![Basic authentication](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/security.png)

   
2. To save your connector after entering the security information, 
at the top of the page, choose **Update connector**, 
then choose **Continue**. 

### 2c. Review, update, or define actions and triggers for your connector

1. Now choose **Definition** so you can review, edit, 
or define new actions and triggers that users can add to their workflows.

   Actions and triggers are based on the operations defined in your WSDL file, which automatically populate the **Definition** page 
   and include the request and response values. So, if the required operations 
   already appear here, you can go to the next step in the registration 
   process without making changes on this page.

   ![Connector definition](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/definition.png)

2. Optionally, if you want to edit existing actions and triggers, 
or add new ones, [continue with these steps](logic-apps-custom-connector-register.md#add-action-or-trigger).


## 3. Finish creating your connector

When you're ready, choose **Update Connector** so you can deploy your connector. 

Congratulations! Now when you create a logic app, 
you can find your connector in Logic Apps Designer, 
and add that connector to your logic app.

![In Logic Apps Designer, find your connector](./media/logic-apps-soap-connector-create-register/soap-connector-created.png)

## Share your connector with other Logic Apps users

Registered but uncertified custom connectors work like 
Microsoft-managed connectors, but are visible and available 
*only* to the connector's author and users who have the same 
Azure Active Directory tenant and Azure subscription 
for logic apps in the region where those apps are deployed. 
Although sharing is optional, you might have scenarios where 
you want to share your connectors with other users. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you share a connector, others might start to depend on that connector. 
> ***Deleting your connector deletes all connections to that connector.***
 
To share your connector with external users outside these boundaries, 
for example, with all Logic Apps users, 
[submit your connector for Microsoft certification](../logic-apps/custom-connector-submit-certification.md).
