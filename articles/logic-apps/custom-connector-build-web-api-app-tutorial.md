# Create custom connectors from Web APIs

To build a custom connector that you can use in Azure Logic Apps, 
Microsoft Flow, or Microsoft PowerApps, first create a Web API that 
you can host with Azure Web Apps, authenticate with Azure Active Directory, 
and register as a connector with Logic Apps, Flow, or PowerApps. 
This tutorial shows you how to perform these tasks 
by building an ASP.NET Web API app. For patterns that 
show you can structure code for your connector's triggers and actions, 
see [Create custom APIs that you can call from logic app workflows](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-api-app.md).

## Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio 2013 or later](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/). 
This tutorial uses Visual Studio 2015.

* Code for your Web API. If you don't have any, try this tutorial: 
[Getting Started with ASP.NET Web API 2 (C#)](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/getting-started-with-aspnet-web-api/tutorial-your-first-web-api).

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have a subscription, 
you can start with a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
Otherwise, sign up for a [Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

## Create and deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure

For this tutorial, create a Visual C# ASP.NET web application. 

1. Open Visual Studio, then choose **File** > **New Project**.

   1. Expand **Installed**, go to **Templates** > **Visual C#** > **Web**, 
   and select **ASP.NET Web Application**.

   2. Provide a project name, location, and solution name for your app, 
   then choose **OK**.

   For example:

   ![Create a Visual C# ASP.NET web application](./media/custom-connector-build-web-api-app-tutorial/visual-studio-new-project-aspnet-web-app.png)

2. In the **New ASP.NET Web Application** box, 
select the **Web API** template. If not already selected, 
select **Host in the cloud**. Choose **Change Authentication**.

   ![Select "Web API" template, "Host in the cloud", "Change Authentication"](./media/custom-connector-build-web-api-app-tutorial/visual-studio-web-api-template.png)

3. Select **No Authentication**, and choose **OK**. 
You can set up authentication later.

   ![Select "No Authentication"](./media/custom-connector-build-web-api-app-tutorial/visual-studio-change-authentication.png)

4. When the **New ASP.NET Web Application** box reappears, choose **OK**. 

5. In the **Create App Service** box, 
review the hosting settings described in the table, 
make the changes you want, and choose **Create**. 

   An [App Service plan](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md) 
   represents a collection of physical resources used for hosting apps in your Azure subscription. Learn about [App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md).

   ![Create App Service](./media/custom-connector-build-web-api-app-tutorial/visual-studio-create-app-service.png)

   | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | Your Azure work or school account, or your personal Microsoft account | *your-user-account* | Select your user account. | 
   | **Web App Name** | *custom-web-api-app-name* or the default name | Enter the name for your Web API app, which is used in your app's URL, for example: http://*web-api-app-name*. | 
   | **Subscription** | *Azure-subscription-name* | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. | 
   | **Resource Group** | *Azure-resource-group-name* | Select an existing Azure resource group, or if you haven't already, create a resource group. <p>**Note**: An Azure resource group organizes Azure resources in your Azure subscription. | 
   | **App Service Plan** | *App-Service-plan-name* | Select an existing App Service plan, or if you haven't already, create a plan. | 
   |||| 

   If you create an App Service Plan, specify these settings:

   | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Location** | *deployment-region* | Select the region for deploying your app. | 
   | **Size** | *App-Service-plan-size* | Select your plan size, which determines the cost and computing resource capacity for your service plan. | 
   |||| 

   To set up any other resources required by your app, 
   choose **Explore additional Azure services**.

   | Setting | Suggested value | Description | 
   | ------- | --------------- | ----------- | 
   | **Resource Type** | *Azure-resource-type* | Select and set up any additional resources required by your app. | 
   |||| 

6. After Visual Studio deploys your project, 
build the code for your app.

## Create an OpenAPI (Swagger) file that describes your Web API

To connect your Web API app to Logic Apps, 
you need an [OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) file](http://swagger.io/) 
that describes your API's operations. 
You can write your own OpenAPI definition for your API with the 
[Swagger online editor](http://editor.swagger.io/), 
but this tutorial uses an open source tool named [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle/blob/master/README.md).

1. If you haven't already, install the Swashbuckle Nuget 
package in your Visual Studio project.

   1. In Visual Studio, choose **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > 
   **Package Manager Console**.

   2. In the **Package Manager Console**, go to your app's project directory if you're not there already (run `Set-Location "project-path"`), and run this PowerShell commandlet: 
   
      `Install-Package Swashbuckle`

      For example:

      ![Package Manager Console, install Swashbuckle](./media/custom-connector-build-web-api-app-tutorial/visual-studio-package-manager-install-swashbuckle.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > If you run your app after installing Swashbuckle, 
   > Swashbuckle generates an OpenAPI file at this URL: 
   >
   > http://*{your-web-api-app-root-URL}*/swagger/docs/v1
   > 
   > Swashbuckle also generates a user interface at this URL: 
   > 
   > http://*{your-web-api-app-root-URL}*/swagger

3. When you're ready, publish your Web API app to Azure. 
To publish from Visual Studio, 
right-click your web project in Solution Explorer, 
choose **Publish...**, and follow the prompts.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Duplicate operation IDs make an OpenAPI document invalid. 
   > If you used the sample C# template, 
   > the template *repeats this operation ID twice*: `Values_Get` 
   > 
   > To fix this problem, change one instance to `Value_Get` and republish.

4. Get the OpenAPI document by browsing to this location: 

   http://*{your-web-api-app-root-URL}*/swagger/docs/v1

   You can also download a [sample OpenAPI document](https://pwrappssamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/webAPI.json) 
   from this tutorial. 
   Make sure that you remove the comments, which starting with "//", 
   before you use the document.

5. Save the content as a JSON file. Based on your browser, 
you might have to copy and paste the text into an empty text file.
