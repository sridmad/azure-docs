# Frequently asked questions in Azure Stack usage API 
This article answers some frequently asked questions about the Azure Stack Usage API.

## What meter IDs can I see?
Currently, usage is reported for the network, storage, and compute
resource providers.

## How do the Azure Stack usage APIs compare to the [Azure usage API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1ea5b323-54bb-423d-916f-190de96c6a3c) (currently in public preview)?
* The Tenant Usage API is consistent with the Azure API, with one
  exception: the *showDetails* flag currently is not supported in
  Azure Stack.
* The Provider Usage API applies only to Azure Stack.
* Currently, the [RateCard
  API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt219004.aspx)
  that is available in Azure is not available in Azure Stack.

## What is the difference between usage time and reported time?
Usage data reports have two main time values:

* **Reported Time**. The time when the usage event entered the usage
  system
* **Usage Time**. The time when the Azure Stack resource was consumed

You might see a discrepancy in values for Usage Time and Reported Time
for a specific usage event. The delay can be as long as multiple hours
in any environment.

Currently, you can query *only by Reported Time*.

## What do these usage API error codes mean?
| **HTTP status code** | **Error code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400/Bad Request |*NoApiVersion* |The *api-version* query parameter is missing. |
| 400/Bad Request |*InvalidProperty* |A property is missing or has an invalid value. The message in the error code in the response body identifies the missing property. |
| 400/Bad Request |*RequestEndTimeIsInFuture* |The value for *ReportedEndTime* is in the future. Values in the future are not allowed for this argument. |
| 400/Bad Request |*SubscriberIdIsNotDirectTenant* |A provider API call used a subscription ID that is not a valid tenant of the caller. |
| 400/Bad Request |*SubscriptionIdMissingInRequest* |The subscription ID of the caller is missing. |
| 400/Bad Request |*InvalidAggregationGranularity* |An invalid aggregation granularity was requested. Valid values are daily and hourly. |
| 503 |*ServiceUnavailable* |A retryable error occurred because the service is busy or the call is being throttled. |
