# Download marketplace items from Azure to Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

As you decide what content to include in your Azure Stack marketplace, you should consider the content available from the Azure marketplace. You can download from a curated list of Azure marketplace items that have been pre-tested to run on Azure Stack. New items are frequently added to this list, so make sure check back for new content.

To download marketplace items, you must first [register Azure Stack with Azure](azure-stack-register.md). 

## Download
1. Sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal (https://portal.local.azurestack.external).
2. Some marketplace items can be very large.  Check to make sure you have enough space on your system by clicking **Resource Providers** > **Storage**.

7. Click **Create** to open up the creation experience for the newly downloaded item. Follow the step-by-step instructions to deploy your item.
