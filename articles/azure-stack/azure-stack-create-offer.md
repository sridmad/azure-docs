# Create an offer in Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

[Offers](azure-stack-key-features.md) are groups of one or more plans that providers present to users to purchase or subscribe to. This document shows you how to create an offer that includes the [plan that you created](azure-stack-create-plan.md) in the last step. This offer gives subscribers the ability to provision virtual machines.

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack administrator portal (https://adminportal.local.azurestack.external) > click **New** > **Tenant Offers + Plans** > **Offer**.

2. In the **New Offer** blade, fill in **Display Name** and **Resource Name**, and then select a new or existing **Resource Group**. The Display Name is the offer's friendly name and is the only information about the offer that the users will see when subscribing. Therefore, be sure to use an intuitive name that helps the user understand what comes with the offer. Only the admin can see the Resource Name. It's the name that admins use to work with the offer as an Azure Resource Manager resource.

3. Click **Base plans** and, in the **Plan** blade, select the plans you want to include in the offer, and then click **Select**. Click **Create** to create the offer.

4. Click **All Resources**, search for your new offer, click on the new offer, click **Change State**, and then click **Public**.

Offers must be made public for users to get the full view when subscribing. Offers can be:

* **Public**: Visible to users.
* **Private**: Only visible to the cloud administrators. Useful while drafting the plan or offer, or if the cloud administrator wants to approve every subscription.
* **Decommissioned**: Closed to new subscribers. The cloud administrator can use decommissioned to prevent future subscriptions, but leave current subscribers untouched.

Changes to the offer are not immediately visible to the user. To see the changes, you might have to logout/login to see the new subscription in the “Subscription picker” when creating resources/resource groups.

> [!NOTE]
>You can also create default offers, plans, and quotas by using PowerShell as explained in the [Azure Stack Service Administrator readme](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/tree/master/ServiceAdmin).
