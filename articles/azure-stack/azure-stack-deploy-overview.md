# Azure Stack Development Kit deployment quickstart

*Applies to: Azure Stack Development Kit*

The [Azure Stack Development Kit](azure-stack-poc.md) is a testing and development environment that you can deploy to evaluate and demonstrate Azure Stack features and services. To get it up and running, you’ll need to prepare the environment hardware and run some scripts (this will take several hours). After that, you can sign in to the admin and user portals to manage Azure Stack and test offers. 

1. [**Plan your hardware, software, and network**](azure-stack-deploy.md). The computer that hosts the development kit (the development kit host) must meet hardware, software, and network requirements. You must also choose between using Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services. Be sure to comply with these prerequisites before starting your deployment so that the installation process runs smoothly. 

2. [**Download and extract the deployment package**](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md#download-and-extract-the-development-kit). You can download the deployment package to the development kit host or to a another computer. The extracted deployment files take up 60 GB of free disk space, so using another computer can help reduce the hardware requirements for the development kit host.

3. [**Prepare the development kit host**](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md#prepare-the-development-kit-host) by using the installer. After this step, the development kit host will boot to the Cloudbuilder.vhdx (a virtual hard drive that includes a bootable operating system and the Azure Stack install files).

4. [**Deploy the development kit**](azure-stack-run-powershell-script.md#deploy-the-development-kit) on the development kit host.

5. If your Azure Stack deployment uses Azure Active Directory, you must [register Azure Stack with Azure](azure-stack-register.md) so that you can [download Azure marketplace items](azure-stack-download-azure-marketplace-item.md) to Azure Stack.

After completing these steps, you’ll have a development kit environment with both administrator and user portals. Next, you can [connect and sign in](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md) to the portal. You can then start deploying resource providers, creating [offers](azure-stack-key-features.md#regions-services-plans-offers-and-subscriptions), and populating the Azure Stack [marketplace](azure-stack-marketplace.md).
