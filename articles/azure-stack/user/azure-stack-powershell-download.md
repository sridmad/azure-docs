# Download Azure Stack tools from GitHub

AzureStack-Tools is a GitHub repository that hosts PowerShell modules that you can use to manage and deploy resources to Azure Stack. You can download and use these PowerShell modules to the Azure Stack Development Kit, or to a windows-based external client if you are planning to establish VPN connectivity. To obtain these tools, clone the GitHub repository or download the AzureStack-Tools folder by running the following script:

```PowerShell
# Change directory to the root directory 
cd \

# Download the tools archive
invoke-webrequest `
  https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip `
  -OutFile master.zip

# Expand the downloaded files
expand-archive master.zip `
  -DestinationPath . `
  -Force

# Change to the tools directory
cd AzureStack-Tools-master
