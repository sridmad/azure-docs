# Sample application that uses keys and secrets stored in a key vault

In this article, we show you how to run a sample application (HelloKeyVault) that retrieves keys and secrets from a key vault in Azure Stack.

## Prerequisites 

Run the following prerequisites either from the [Development Kit](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-remote-desktop), or from a Windows-based external client if you are [connected through VPN](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-vpn):

* Install [Azure Stack-compatible Azure PowerShell modules](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).  
* Download the [tools required to work with Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-download.md). 

## Create and get the key vault and application settings

First, you should create a key vault in Azure Stack, and register an application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You can create and register the key vaults by using the Azure portal or PowerShell. This article shows you the PowerShell way to do the tasks. By default, this PowerShell script creates a new application in Active Directory. However, you can also use one of your existing applications. Make sure to provide a value for the `aadTenantName` and `applicationPassword` variables. If you don't specify a value for the `applicationPassword` variable, this script generates a random password. 

```powershell
$vaultName           = 'myVault'
$resourceGroupName   = 'myResourceGroup'
$applicationName     = 'myApp'
$location            = 'local' 

# Password for the application. If not specified, this script will generate a random password during app creation.
$applicationPassword = '' 
                         
# Function to generate a random password for the application.
Function GenerateSymmetricKey()
{
    $key = New-Object byte[](32)
    $rng = [System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider]::Create()
    $rng.GetBytes($key)
    return [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($key)
}

Write-Host 'Please log into your Azure Stack user environment' -foregroundcolor Green

$tenantARM = "https://management.local.azurestack.external"
$aadTenantName = "PLEASE FILL THIS IN WITH YOUR AAD TENANT NAME. FOR EXAMPLE: myazurestack.onmicrosoft.com"

# Configure the Azure Stack operatorâ€™s PowerShell environment.
Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
  -Name "AzureStackUser" `
  -ArmEndpoint $tenantARM

Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
  -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
  -GraphAudience "https://graph.windows.net/"

$TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
  -AADTenantName $aadTenantName `
  -EnvironmentName AzureStackUser

# Sign in to the user portal.
Login-AzureRmAccount `
  -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
  -TenantId $TenantID `
  
$now = [System.DateTime]::Now
$oneYearFromNow = $now.AddYears(1)

$applicationPassword = GenerateSymmetricKey
	
# Create a new Azure AD application.
$identifierUri = [string]::Format("http://localhost:8080/{0}",[Guid]::NewGuid().ToString("N"))
$homePage = "http://contoso.com"

Write-Host "Creating a new AAD Application"
$ADApp = New-AzureRmADApplication `
  -DisplayName $applicationName `
  -HomePage $homePage `
  -IdentifierUris $identifierUri `
  -StartDate $now `
  -EndDate $oneYearFromNow `
  -Password $applicationPassword

Write-Host "Creating a new AAD service principal"
$servicePrincipal = New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal `
  -ApplicationId $ADApp.ApplicationId

# Create a new resource group and a key vault within that resource group.
New-AzureRmResourceGroup `
  -Name $resourceGroupName `
  -Location $location   

Write-Host "Creating vault $vaultName"
$vault = New-AzureRmKeyVault -VaultName $vaultName `
  -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
  -Sku standard `
  -Location $location

# Specify full privileges to the vault for the application.
Write-Host "Setting access policy"
Set-AzureRmKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $vaultName `
  -ObjectId $servicePrincipal.Id `
  -PermissionsToKeys all `
  -PermissionsToSecrets all

Write-Host "Paste the following settings into the app.config file for the HelloKeyVault project:"
'<add key="VaultUrl" value="' + $vault.VaultUri + '"/>'
'<add key="AuthClientId" value="' + $servicePrincipal.ApplicationId + '"/>'
'<add key="AuthClientSecret" value="' + $applicationPassword + '"/>'
Write-Host

``` 

The following screenshot shows the output of the previous script:

Make a note of the **VaultUrl**, **AuthClientId**, and **AuthClientSecret** values returned by the previous script. You use these values to run the HelloKeyVault application.

## Download and run the sample application

Download the key vault sample from the Azure [Key Vault client samples](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45343) page. Extract the contents of the .zip file onto your development workstation. There are two samples within the samples folder. We use the HellpKeyVault sample in this topic. Browse to the **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Samples** > **samples** > **HelloKeyVault** folder and open the HelloKeyVault application in Visual Studio. 

Open the HelloKeyVault\App.config file and replace the values of the <appSettings> element with the **VaultUrl**, **AuthClientId**, and **AuthClientSecret** values returned by the previous script. Note that by default the App.config contains a placeholder for *AuthCertThumbprint*, but use *AuthClientSecret* instead. After you replace the settings, rebuild the solution and start the application.

The application signs in to Azure AD, and then uses that token to authenticate to the key vault in Azure Stack. The application performs operations like create, encrypt, wrap, and delete on the keys and secrets of the key vault. You can also pass specific parameters such as *encrypt* and *decrypt* to the application, which makes sure that the application executes only those operations against the vault.
