# Configure the Azure Stack user's PowerShell environment

As an Azure Stack user, you can configure your Azure Stack Development Kit's PowerShell environment. After you configure, you can use PowerShell to manage Azure Stack resources such as subscribe to offers, create virtual machines, deploy Azure Resource Manager templates,  etc. This topic is scoped to use with the user environments only, if you want to set up PowerShell for the cloud operator environment, refer to the [Configure the Azure Stack operator's PowerShell environment](../azure-stack-powershell-configure-admin.md) topic. 

## Prerequisites 

Run the following prerequisites either from the [development kit](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-remote-desktop), or from a Windows-based external client if you are [connected through VPN](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#connect-to-azure-stack-with-vpn):

* Install [Azure Stack-compatible Azure PowerShell modules](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).  
* Download the [tools required to work with Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-download.md). 

## Configure the user environment and sign in to Azure Stack

Based on the type of deployment (Azure AD or AD FS), run one of the following script to configure PowerShell for Azure Stack (Make sure to replace the AAD tenantName, GraphAudience endpoint and ArmEndpoint values as per your environment configuration):

### Azure Active Directory (AAD) based deployments
       
  ```powershell
  # Navigate to the downloaded folder and import the **Connect** PowerShell module
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1

  # For Azure Stack development kit, this value is set to https://management.local.azurestack.external. To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
  $ArmEndpoint = "<Resource Manager endpoint for your environment>"

  # For Azure Stack development kit, this value is set to https://graph.windows.net/. To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
  $GraphAudience = "<GraphAudience endpoint for your environment>"

  # Register an AzureRM environment that targets your Azure Stack instance
  Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -ArmEndpoint $ArmEndpoint

  # Set the GraphEndpointResourceId value
  Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -GraphAudience $GraphAudience

  # Get the Active Directory tenantId that is used to deploy Azure Stack
  $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
    -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser"

  # Sign in to your environment
  Login-AzureRmAccount `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
    -TenantId $TenantID 
   ```

### Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) based deployments 
          
  ```powershell
  # Navigate to the downloaded folder and import the **Connect** PowerShell module
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1

  # For Azure Stack development kit, this value is set to https://management.local.azurestack.external. To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
  $ArmEndpoint = "<Resource Manager endpoint for your environment>"

  # For Azure Stack development kit, this value is set to https://graph.local.azurestack.external/. To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
  $GraphAudience = "<GraphAudience endpoint for your environment>"

  # Register an AzureRM environment that targets your Azure Stack instance
  Add-AzureRMEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -ArmEndpoint $ArmEndpoint

  # Set the GraphEndpointResourceId value
  Set-AzureRmEnvironment `
    -Name "AzureStackUser" `
    -GraphAudience $GraphAudience `
    -EnableAdfsAuthentication:$true

  # Get the Active Directory tenantId that is used to deploy Azure Stack     
  $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
    -ADFS `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser"

  # Sign in to your environment
  Login-AzureRmAccount `
    -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
    -TenantId $TenantID 
  ```

## Register resource providers

When operating on a newly created user subscription that doesnâ€™t have any resources deployed through the portal, the resource providers aren't automatically registered. You should explicitly register them by using the following script:

```powershell
foreach($s in (Get-AzureRmSubscription)) {
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId $s.SubscriptionId | Out-Null
        Write-Progress $($s.SubscriptionId + " : " + $s.SubscriptionName)
Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ListAvailable | Register-AzureRmResourceProvider -Force
    } 
```

## Test the connectivity

Now that we've got everything set up, let's use PowerShell to create resources within Azure Stack. For example, you can create a resource group for an application and add a virtual machine. Use the following command to create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup":

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name "MyResourceGroup" -Location "Local"
```
