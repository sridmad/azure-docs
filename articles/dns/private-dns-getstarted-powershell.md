# Get started with Azure DNS private zones using PowerShell

This article walks you through the steps to create your first private DNS zone and record using Azure PowerShell.

A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for a particular domain. To start hosting your domain in Azure DNS, you need to create a DNS zone for that domain name. Each DNS record for your domain is then created inside this DNS zone. To publish a private DNS zone to your virtual network, you specify the list of virtual networks that are allowed to resolve records within the zone.  We call these 'resolution networks'.  You may also specify a set of virtual networks for which Azure DNS will maintain hostname records whenever a VM is created, changes IP, or is destroyed.  We call these 'registration networks'.

As this feature is currently a managed preview, a preview PowerShell module will be provided.

## Create the resource group

Before creating the DNS zone, a resource group is created to contain the DNS zone. The following shows the command.

```powershell
New-AzureRMResourceGroup -name MyResourceGroup -location "westus"
```

## Create a DNS zone

A DNS zone is created by using the `New-AzureRmDnsZone` cmdlet. The following example creates a DNS zone called *contoso.local* in the resource group called *MyResourceGroup* and makes the DNS zone available to the virtual network called *MyAzureVnet*. Use the example to create a DNS zone, substituting the values for your own.

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name MyAzureVnet -ResourceGroupName VnetResourceGroup
New-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.local -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -ZoneType Private -ResolutionVirtualNetworkId @($vnet.Id)
```

If you need Azure to automatically create hostname records in the zone, use the *RegistrationVirtualNetworkId* parameter instead of *ResolutionVirtualNetworkId*.  Registration virtual networks are automatically enabled for resolution.

```powershell
$vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name MyAzureVnet -ResourceGroupName VnetResourceGroup
New-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.local -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -ZoneType Private -RegistrationVirtualNetworkId @($vnet.Id)
```


## Create a DNS record

You create record sets by using the `New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. The following example creates a record with the relative name "db" in the DNS Zone "contoso.local", in resource group "MyResourceGroup". The fully-qualified name of the record set is "db.contoso.local". The record type is "A", with IP address "10.0.0.4", and the TTL is 3600 seconds.

```powershell
New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name db -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.local -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup -Ttl 3600 -DnsRecords (New-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -IPv4Address "10.0.0.4")
```

For other record types, for record sets with more than one record, and to modify existing records, see [Manage DNS records and record sets using Azure PowerShell](dns-operations-recordsets.md). 


## View records

To list the DNS records in your zone, use:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.local -ResourceGroupName MyResourceGroup
```

## Delete all resources

To delete all resources created in this article, take the following step:

```powershell
Remove-AzureRMResourceGroup -Name MyResourceGroup
```
