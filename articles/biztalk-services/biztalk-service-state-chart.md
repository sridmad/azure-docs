# What you can and can't do using the BizTalk Service state

> [!INCLUDE [BizTalk Services is being retired, and replaced with Azure Logic Apps](../../includes/biztalk-services-retirement.md)]

Depending on the current state of the BizTalk service, there are operations that you can or cannot perform on the BizTalk service.

For example, you provision a new BizTalk service. When it completes successfully, the BizTalk service is in `active` state. In the active state, you can stop, suspend, and delete the BizTalk service. If you stop the BizTalk service, and stop fails, then the BizTalk service goes to a `StopFailed` state. In the `StopFailed` state, you can restart the BizTalk service. If you try an operation that is not allowed, like resume, the following error occurs:

`Operation not allowed`

## View the possible states

The following tables list the operations or actions that can be done when the BizTalk Service is in a specific state. A ✔ means the operation is allowed while in that state. A blank entry means the operation cannot be performed while in that state.
