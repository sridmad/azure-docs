# How to configure high availability ports for Internal Load Balancer

This article provides an example deployment of high availability (HA) ports on an Internal Load Balancer. For Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) specific configurations, refer to the corresponding provider websites.

>[!NOTE]
> High Availability Ports feature is currently in Preview. During preview, the feature may not have the same level of availability and reliability as features that are in general availability release. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Figure 1 illustrates the following configuration of the deployment example described in this article:
- The NVAs are deployed in the backend pool of an Internal Load Balancer behind the HA ports configuration. 
- The UDR applied on the DMZ Subnet routes all traffic to the NVAs by making the next hop as the Internal Load Balancer Virtual IP. 
- Internal Load Balancer distributes the traffic to one of the active NVAs according to the LB algorithm.
- NVA processes the traffic and forwards it to the original destination in the backend subnet.
- The return path can also take the same route if a corresponding UDR is configured in the backend subnet.

## Preview sign-up

To participate in the Preview of the HA ports feature in Load Balancer Standard, register your subscription to gain access using either Azure CLI 2.0 or PowerShell.  Please register your subscription for

1. [Load Balancer Standard preview](https://aka.ms/lbpreview#preview-sign-up) and 
2. [HA Ports preview](https://aka.ms/haports#preview-sign-up).

>[!NOTE]
>To use this feature, you must also sign-up for Load Balancer [Standard Preview](https://aka.ms/lbpreview#preview-sign-up) in addition to HA Ports. Registration of the HA Ports or Load Balancer Standard previews may take up to an hour.

## Configuring HA Ports

The configuration of the HA ports involves setting up an Internal Load Balancer, with the NVAs in the backend pool, a corresponding load balancer health probe configuration to detect NVA health, and the Load Balancer rule with HA ports. The general Load Balancer related configuration is covered in [Get Started](load-balancer-get-started-ilb-arm-portal.md). This article highlights the HA ports configuration.

The configuration essentially involves setting the frontend port and backend port value to **0**, and the protocol value to **All**. This article describes how to configure high availability ports using Azure portal, PowerShell, and Azure CLI 2.0.

### Configure HA ports load balancer rule with the Azure portal

The Azure portal includes the **HA Ports** option via a checkbox for this configuration. When selected, the related port and protocol configuration is automatically populated.

### Configure HA Ports LB Rule via Resource Manager Template

You can configure HA ports using the 2017-08-01 API version for Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers in the Load Balancer resource. The following JSON snippet illustrates the changes in the Load Balancer configuration for HA Ports via REST API.

```json
    {
        "apiVersion": "2017-08-01",
        "type": "Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers",
        ...
        "sku":
        {
            "name": "Standard"
        },
        ...
        "properties": {
            "frontendIpConfigurations": [...],
            "backendAddressPools": [...],
            "probes": [...],
            "loadBalancingRules": [
             {
                "properties": {
                    ...
                    "protocol": "All",
                    "frontendPort": 0,
                    "backendPort": 0
                }
             }
            ],
       ...
       }
    }
```

### Configure HA ports load balancer rule with PowerShell

Use the following command to create the HA Ports Load Balancer rule while creating the Internal Load Balancer with PowerShell:

```powershell
lbrule = New-AzureRmLoadBalancerRuleConfig -Name "HAPortsRule" -FrontendIpConfiguration $frontendIP -BackendAddressPool $beAddressPool -Probe $healthProbe -Protocol "All" -FrontendPort 0 -BackendPort 0
```

### Configure HA ports load balancer rule with Azure CLI 2.0

At Step # 4 of [Creating an internal Load Balancer Set](load-balancer-get-started-ilb-arm-cli.md), use the following command to create the HA ports Load Balancer rule.

```azurecli
azure network lb rule create --resource-group contoso-rg --lb-name contoso-ilb --name haportsrule --protocol all --frontend-port 0 --backend-port 0 --frontend-ip-name feilb --backend-address-pool-name beilb
```
