# Understanding outbound connections in Azure

[!INCLUDE [load-balancer-basic-sku-include.md](../../includes/load-balancer-basic-sku-include.md)]

A Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure can communicate with endpoints outside of Azure in public IP address space. When a VM initiates an outbound flow to a destination in public IP address space, Azure maps the VM's private IP address to a public IP address and allows return traffic to reach the VM.

Azure provides three different methods to achieve outbound connectivity. Each method has its own capabilities and constraints. Review each method carefully to choose which one meets your needs.

| Scenario | Method | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone VM (no load balancer, no Instance Level Public IP address) |Default SNAT |Azure associates a public IP address for SNAT |
| Load-balanced VM (no Instance Level Public IP address on VM) |SNAT using the load balancer |Azure uses a public IP address of the Load Balancer for SNAT |
| VM with Instance Level Public IP address (with or without load balancer) |SNAT is not used |Azure uses the public IP assigned to the VM |

If you do not want a VM to communicate with endpoints outside of Azure in public IP address space, you can use Network Security Groups (NSG) to block access. Using NSGs is discussed in more detail in [Preventing Public Connectivity](#preventing-public-connectivity).

## Standalone VM with no Instance Level Public IP address

In this scenario, the VM is not part of an Azure Load Balancer pool and does not have an Instance Level Public IP (ILPIP) address assigned to it. When the VM creates an outbound flow, Azure translates the private source IP address of the outbound flow to a public source IP address. The public IP address used for this outbound flow is not configurable and does not count against the subscription's public IP resource limit. Azure uses Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) to perform this function. Ephemeral ports of the public IP address are used to distinguish individual flows originated by the VM. SNAT dynamically allocates ephemeral ports when flows are created. In this context, the ephemeral ports used for SNAT are referred to as SNAT ports.

SNAT ports are a finite resource that can be exhausted. It is important to understand how they are consumed. One SNAT port is consumed per flow to a single destination IP. For multiple flows to the same destination IP address and port, each flow consumes a single SNAT port. This ensures that the flows are unique when originated from the same public IP address to the same destination IP address and port. Multiple flows, each to a different destination IP address and port, share a single SNAT port. The destination IP address and port makes the flows unique.

You can use [Log Analytics for Load Balancer](load-balancer-monitor-log.md) and [Alert event logs to monitor for SNAT port exhaustion messages](load-balancer-monitor-log.md#alert-event-log) to monitor health of outbound connections. When SNAT port resources are exhausted, outbound flows fail until SNAT ports are released by existing flows. Load Balancer uses a 4-minute idle timeout for reclaiming SNAT ports.  Review [VM with an Instance Level Public IP address (with or without Load Balancer)](#vm-with-an-instance-level-public-ip-address-with-or-without-load-balancer) the following section as well as [Managing SNAT exhaustion](#snatexhaust).

## Load-balanced VM with no Instance Level Public IP address

In this scenario, the VM is part of an Azure Load Balancer pool.  The VM does not have a public IP address assigned to it. The Load Balancer resource must be configured with a rule to link the public IP frontend with the backend pool.  If you do not complete this configuration, the behavior is as described in the preceding section for [Standalone VM with no Instance Level Public IP](load-balancer-outbound-connections.md#standalone-vm-with-no-instance-level-public-ip-address).

When the load-balanced VM creates an outbound flow, Azure translates the private source IP address of the outbound flow to the public IP address of the public Load Balancer frontend. Azure uses Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) to perform this function. Ephemeral ports of the Load Balancer's public IP address are used to distinguish individual flows originated by the VM. SNAT dynamically allocates ephemeral ports when outbound flows are created. In this context, the ephemeral ports used for SNAT are referred to as SNAT ports.

SNAT ports are a finite resource that can be exhausted. It is important to understand how they are consumed. One SNAT port is consumed per flow to a single destination IP address and port. For multiple flows to the same destination IP address and port, each flow consumes a single SNAT port. This ensures that the flows are unique when originated from the same public IP address to the same destination IP address and port. Multiple flows, each to a different destination IP address and port, share a single SNAT port. The destination IP address and port makes the flows unique.

You can use [Log Analytics for Load Balancer](load-balancer-monitor-log.md) and [Alert event logs to monitor for SNAT port exhaustion messages](load-balancer-monitor-log.md#alert-event-log) to monitor health of outbound connections. When SNAT port resources are exhausted, outbound flows fail until SNAT ports are released by existing flows. Load Balancer uses a 4-minute idle timeout for reclaiming SNAT ports.  Review the following section as well as [Managing SNAT exhaustion](#snatexhaust).

## VM with an Instance Level Public IP address (with or without Load Balancer)

In this scenario, the VM has an Instance Level Public IP (ILPIP) assigned to it. It does not matter whether the VM is load balanced or not. When an ILPIP is used, Source Network Address Translation (SNAT) is not used. The VM uses the ILPIP for all outbound flows. If your application initiates many outbound flows and you experience SNAT exhaustion, you should consider assigning an ILPIP to mitigate SNAT constraints.

## Discovering the public IP used by a given VM

There are many ways to determine the public source IP address of an outbound connection. OpenDNS provides a service that can show you the public IP address of your VM. Using the nslookup command, you can send a DNS query for the name myip.opendns.com to the OpenDNS resolver. The service returns the source IP address that was used to send the query. When you execute the following query from your VM, the response is the public IP used for that VM.

    nslookup myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com

## Preventing Public Connectivity

Sometimes it is undesirable for a VM to be allowed to create an outbound flow or there may be a requirement to manage which destinations can be reached with outbound flows or which destinations may begin inbound flows. In this case, you use [Network Security Groups (NSG)](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md) to manage the destinations that the VM can reach as well as which public destination can initiate inbound flows. When you apply an NSG to a load-balanced VM, you need to pay attention to the [default tags](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md#default-tags) and [default rules](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md#default-rules).

You must ensure that the VM can receive health probe requests from Azure Load Balancer. If an NSG blocks health probe requests from the AZURE_LOADBALANCER default tag, your VM health probe fails and the VM is marked down. Load Balancer stops sending new flows to that VM.

## <a name="snatexhaust"></a>Managing SNAT exhaustion

Ephemeral ports used for SNAT are an exhaustible resource as described in [Standalone VM with no Instance Level Public IP address](#standalone-vm-with-no-instance-level-public-ip-address) and [Load-balanced VM with no Instance Level Public IP address](#standalone-vm-with-no-instance-level-public-ip-address).

If you know you are initiating many outbound TCP or UDP connections to the same destination IP address and port, observe failing outbound connections, or are advised by support you are exhausting SNAT ports, you have several general mitigation options.  Review these options and decide what is best for your scenario.  It is possible one or more can help manage this scenario.

### Modify application to reuse connections 
You can reduce demand for ephemeral ports used for SNAT by reusing connections in your application.  This is especially true for protocols like HTTP/1.1 where connection reuse is the default.  And other protocols using HTTP as their transport (i.e. REST) can benefit in turn.  Reuse is always better than individual, atomic TCP connections for each request, and results in more performant, very efficient TCP transactions.

### Modify application to use connection pooling
You can employ a connection pooling scheme in your application, where requests are internally distributed across a fixed set of connections (each reusing where possible).  This constraints the number of ephemeral ports in use and creates a more predictable environment.  This can also increase the throughput of requests by allowing multiple simultaneous operations when a single connection is blocking on the reply of an operation.  Connection pooling may already exist within the framework you are using to develop your application or the configurations settings for your application.  You can combine this with connection reuse and your multiple requests consume a fixed, predictable number of ports to the same destination IP address and port while also benefiting from very efficient use of TCP transactions reducing latency and resource utilization.

### Modify application to use less aggressive retry logic
When ephemeral ports used for SNAT are exhausted or application failures occur, aggressive or brute force retries without decay and backoff logic cause exhaustion to occur or persist. You can reduce demand for ephemeral ports by using a less aggressive retry logic.   Ephemeral ports have a 4-minute idle timeout (not adjustable) and if the retries are too aggressive, the exhaustion has no opportunity to clear up on its own.  Therefore, considering how and how often your application retries transactions is a critical consideration of the design.

### Assign an Instance-Level Public IP to each VM
This changes your scenario to [Instance-Level Public IP to a VM](#vm-with-an-instance-level-public-ip-address-with-or-without-load-balancer).  All ephemeral ports of the Public IP used for each VM are available to the VM (as opposed to scenarios where ephemeral ports of a Public IP are shared with all the VM's associated with the respective backend pool).  There are trade-offs to consider, such as additional cost of IP addresses and potential impact of whitelisting a large number of individual IP addresses.

## Limitations

If [multiple (public) IP addresses are associated with a load balancer](load-balancer-multivip-overview.md), any of these public IP addresses are a candidate for outbound flows.

Azure uses an algorithm to determine the number of SNAT ports available based on the size of the pool.  This is not configurable at this time.

Outbound connections have a 4-minute idle timeout.  This is not adjustable.

It is important to remember that the number of SNAT ports available does not translate directly to number of connections. Refer preceding sections for specifics on when and how SNAT ports are allocated and [how to manage this exhaustible resource](#snatexhaust).
