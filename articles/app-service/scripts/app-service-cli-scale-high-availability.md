# Scale a web app worldwide with a high-availability architecture

In this scenario you will create a resource group, two app service plans, two web apps, a traffic manager profile, and two traffic manager endpoints. Once the exercise is complete you will have a high-available architecture which allows provides global availability of your web app based on the lowest network latency.

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 


## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/scale-geographic/scale-geographic.sh "Geographic Scale")]

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, web app, traffic manager profile, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az appservice plan create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/appservice/plan#az_appservice_plan_create) | Creates an App Service plan. This is like a server farm for your Azure web app. |
| [az webapp create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp#az_webapp_create) | Creates an Azure web app. |
| [az network traffic-manager profile create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/traffic-manager/profile#az_network_traffic_manager_profile_create) | Creates an Azure Traffic Manager profile. |
