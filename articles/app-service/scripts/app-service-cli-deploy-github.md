# Create a web app with deployment from GitHub

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys your web app code from a public GitHub repository (without continuous deployment). For GitHub deployment with continuous deployment, see [Create a web app with continuous deployment from GitHub](app-service-cli-continuous-deployment-github.md).

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
