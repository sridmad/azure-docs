# Run interactive queries on an HDInsight Spark cluster

In this article, you use a Jupyter notebook to run interactive Spark SQL queries against a Spark cluster. Jupyter notebook is a browser-based application that extends the console-based interactive experience to the Web. For more information, see [The Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html).

For this tutorial, you use the **PySpark** kernel in the Jupyter notebook to run an interactive Spark SQL query. Jupyter notebooks on HDInsight clusters also support two other kernels - **PySpark3** and **Spark**. For more information about the kernels, and the benefits of using **PySpark**, see [Use Jupyter notebook kernels with Apache Spark clusters in HDInsight](apache-spark-jupyter-notebook-kernels.md).

## Prerequisites

* **An Azure HDInsight Spark cluster**. For instructions, see [Create an Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight](apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md).

## Create a Jupyter notebook to run interactive queries

To run queries, we use sample data that is by default available in the storage associated with the cluster. However, you must first load that data into Spark as a dataframe. Once you have the dataframe, you can run queries on it using the Jupyter notebook. In this article, you look at how to:

* Register a sample data set as a Spark dataframe.
* Run queries on the dataframe.

Let's get started.

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). If you opted to pin the cluster to the dashboard, click the cluster tile from the dashboard to launch the cluster blade.

	If you did not pin the cluster to the dashboard, from the left pane, click **HDInsight clusters**, and then click the cluster you created.

3. From **Quick links**, click **Cluster dashboards**, and then click **Jupyter Notebook**. If prompted, enter the admin credentials for the cluster.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may also access the Jupyter notebook for your cluster by opening the following URL in your browser. Replace **CLUSTERNAME** with the name of your cluster:
   >
   > `https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net/jupyter`
   >
   >
3. Create a notebook. Click **New**, and then click **PySpark**.

   ![Create a Jupyter notebook to run interactive Spark SQL query](./media/apache-spark-load-data-run-query/hdinsight-spark-create-jupyter-interactive-Spark-SQL-query.png "Create a Jupyter notebook to run interactive Spark SQL query")

   A new notebook is created and opened with the name Untitled(Untitled.pynb).

4. Click the notebook name at the top, and enter a friendly name if you want.

    ![Provide a name for the Jupter notebook to run interactive Spark query from](./media/apache-spark-load-data-run-query/hdinsight-spark-jupyter-notebook-name.png "Provide a name for the Jupter notebook to run interactive Spark query from")

5. Paste the following code in an empty cell, and then press **SHIFT + ENTER** to run the code. The code imports the types required for this scenario:

		from pyspark.sql import *
        from pyspark.sql.types import *

    Because you created a notebook using the PySpark kernel, you do not need to create any contexts explicitly. The Spark and Hive contexts are automatically created for you when you run the first code cell.

    Every time you run an interactive query in Jupyter, your web browser window title shows a **(Busy)** status along with the notebook title. You also see a solid circle next to the **PySpark** text in the top-right corner. After the job is completed, it changes to a hollow circle.

6. Before you load the data into a Spark cluster, let us look a snapshot of it. The sample data used in this tutorial is available as a CSV file on all HDInsight Spark clusters at **\HdiSamples\HdiSamples\SensorSampleData\hvac\hvac.csv**. The data captures the temperature variations of a building. Here are the first few rows of the data.

6. Create a dataframe and a temporary table (**hvac**) by running the following code. For this tutorial, we do not create all the columns available in the CSV file. 

		# Create an RDD from sample data
        hvacText = sc.textFile("wasbs:///HdiSamples/HdiSamples/SensorSampleData/hvac/HVAC.csv")

        # Create a schema for our data
        Entry = Row('Date', 'Time', 'TargetTemp', 'ActualTemp', 'BuildingID')

        # Parse the data and create a schema
        hvacParts = hvacText.map(lambda s: s.split(',')).filter(lambda s: s[0] != 'Date')
        hvac = hvacParts.map(lambda p: Entry(str(p[0]), str(p[1]), int(p[2]), int(p[3]), int(p[6])))
        
        # Infer the schema and create a table       
        hvacTable = sqlContext.createDataFrame(hvac)
        hvacTable.registerTempTable('hvactemptable')
        dfw = DataFrameWriter(hvacTable)
        dfw.saveAsTable('hvac')

7. Once the table is created, run an interactive query on the data, use the following code.

		%%sql
		SELECT buildingID, (targettemp - actualtemp) AS temp_diff, date FROM hvac WHERE date = \"6/1/13\"

   Because you are using a PySpark kernel, you can now directly run an interactive SQL query on the temporary table **hvac** that you created by using the `%%sql` magic. For more information about the `%%sql` magic, and other magics available with the PySpark kernel, see [Kernels available on Jupyter notebooks with Spark HDInsight clusters](apache-spark-jupyter-notebook-kernels.md#parameters-supported-with-the-sql-magic).

   The following tabular output is displayed by default.

     ![Table output of interactive Spark query result](./media/apache-spark-load-data-run-query/hdinsight-interactive-spark-query-result.png "Table output of interactive Spark query result")

9. You can also see the results in other visualizations as well. To see an area graph for the same output, select **Area** then set other values as shown.

    ![Area graph of interactive Spark query result](./media/apache-spark-load-data-run-query/hdinsight-interactive-spark-query-result-area-chart.png "Area graph of interactive Spark query result")

10. From the **File** menu on the notebook, click **Save and Checkpoint**. 

11. If you're starting the [next tutorial](apache-spark-use-bi-tools.md) now, leave the notebook open. If not, shut down the notebook to release the cluster resources: from the **File** menu on the notebook, click **Close and Halt**.

## Next step

In this article you learned how to run interactive queries in Spark using Jupyter notebook. Advance to the next article to see how the data you registered in Spark can be pulled into a BI analytics tool such as Power BI and Tableau.
