# Get started using R Server on HDInsight

HDInsight includes an R Server option to be integrated into your HDInsight cluster. This option allows R scripts to use Spark and MapReduce to run distributed computations. In this document, you learn how to create an R Server on HDInsight cluster and then run an R script that demonstrates using Spark for distributed R computations.


## Prerequisites

* **An Azure subscription**: Before you begin this tutorial, you must have an Azure subscription. Go to the article [Get Microsoft Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/) for more information.
* **A Secure Shell (SSH) client**: An SSH client is used to remotely connect to the HDInsight cluster and run commands directly on the cluster. For more information, see [Use SSH with HDInsight.](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md)
* **SSH keys (optional)**: You can secure the SSH account used to connect to the cluster using either a password or a public key. Using a password is easier, and allows you to get started without having to create a public/private key pair. However, using a key is more secure.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this document assume that you are using a password.


## Automated cluster creation

You can automate the creation of HDInsight R Servers using Azure Resource Manager templates, the SDK, and also PowerShell.

* To create an R Server using an Azure Resource Management template, see [Deploy an R server HDInsight cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/101-hdinsight-rserver/).
* To create an R Server using the .NET SDK, see [create Linux-based clusters in HDInsight using the .NET SDK.](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-dotnet-sdk.md)
* To deploy R Server using powershell, see the article on [creating an R Server on HDInsight with PowerShell](../hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-azure-powershell.md).


<a name="create-hdi-custer-with-aure-portal"></a>
## Create the cluster using the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Select **NEW** -> **Intelligence + Analytics**, -> **HDInsight**.

    ![Image of creating a new cluster](./media/r-server-get-started/newcluster.png)

3. In the **Quick create** experience, enter a name for the cluster in the **Cluster Name** field. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, use the **Subscription** entry to select the one you want to use.

    ![Cluster name and subscription selections](./media/r-server-get-started/clustername.png)

4. Select **Cluster type** to open the **Cluster configuration** blade. On the **Cluster Configuration** blade, select the following options:

   	* **Cluster Type**: R Server
   	* **Version**: select the version of R Server to install on the cluster. The version currently available is ***R Server 9.1 (HDI 3.6)***. Release notes for the available versions of R Server are available [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/notes/r-server-notes).
   	* **R Studio community edition for R Server**: this browser-based IDE is installed by default on the edge node. If you would prefer to not have it installed, then uncheck the check box. If you choose to have it installed, the URL for accessing the RStudio Server login is found on a portal application blade for your cluster once it’s been created.
   	* Leave the other options at the default values and use the **Select** button to save the cluster type.

   		![Cluster type blade screenshot](./media/r-server-get-started/clustertypeconfig.png)

5. Enter a **Cluster login username** and **Cluster login password**.

   	Specify an **SSH Username**. SSH is used to remotely connect to the cluster using a **Secure Shell (SSH)** client. You can either specify the SSH user in this dialog or after the cluster has been created (in the Configuration tab for the cluster). R Server is configured to expect an **SSH username** of “remoteuser”.  **If you use a different username, you must perform an additional step after the cluster is created.**

   	Leave the box checked for **Use same password as cluster login** to use **PASSWORD** as the authentication type unless you prefer use of a public key.  You need a public/private key pair to access R Server on the cluster via a remote client as, for example, RTVS, RStudio or another desktop IDE. If you install the RStudio Server community edition, you need to choose an SSH password.     

   	To create and use a public/private key pair, uncheck **Use same password as cluster login** and then select **PUBLIC KEY** and proceed as follows. These instructions assume that you have Cygwin with ssh-keygen or an equivalent installed.

   	* Generate a public/private key pair from the command prompt on your laptop:

		ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

   	* Follow the prompt to name a key file and then enter a passphrase for added security. Your screen should look something like the following image:

   		![SSH cmd line in Windows](./media/r-server-get-started/sshcmdline.png)

   	* This command creates a private key file and a public key file under the name <private-key-filename>.pub, for example furiosa and furiosa.pub.

   		![SSH dir](./media/r-server-get-started/dir.png)

   	* Then specify the public key file (&#42;.pub) when assigning HDI cluster credentials and finally confirm your resource group and region and select **Next**.

   		![Credentials blade](./media/r-server-get-started/publickeyfile.png)  

   * Change permissions on the private keyfile on your laptop:

		chmod 600 <private-key-filename>

   * Use the private key file with SSH for remote login:

		ssh –i <private-key-filename> remoteuser@<hostname public ip>

   	  Or, as part the definition of your Hadoop Spark compute context for R Server on the client. See the **Using Microsoft R Server as a Hadoop Client** subsection in [Create a Compute Context for Spark](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/scaler-spark-getting-started#creating-a-compute-context-for-spark).

6. The quick create transitions you to the **Storage** blade to select the storage account settings to be used for the primary location of the HDFS file system used by the cluster. Select either a new or existing Azure Storage account or an existing Data Lake Storage account.

	- If you select an Azure Storage account, an existing storage account is selected by choosing **Select a storage account** and then selecting the relevant account. Create a new account using the **Create New** link in the **Select a storage account** section.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you select **New** you must enter a name for the new storage account. A green check appears if the name is accepted.

      The **Default Container** defaults to the name of the cluster. Leave this default as the value.

      If a new storage account option was selected a prompt to select **Location** is given to select which region to create the storage account.  

         ![Data source blade](./media/r-server-get-started/datastore.png)  

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Selecting the location for the default data source  also sets the location of the HDInsight cluster. The cluster and default data source must be in the same region.

	- If you want to use an existing Data Lake Store, then select the ADLS storage account to use and add the cluster *ADD* identity to your cluster to allow access to the store. For more information on this process, see [Creating HDInsight cluster with Data Lake Store using Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-hdinsight-hadoop-use-portal).

   	Use the **Select** button to save the data source configuration.


7. The **Summary** blade then displays to validate all your settings. Here you can change your **Cluster size** to modify the number of servers in your cluster and also specify any **Script actions** you want to run. Unless you know that you need a larger cluster, leave the number of worker nodes at the default of `4`. The estimated cost of the cluster is shown within the blade.

   	![cluster summary](./media/r-server-get-started/clustersummary.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If needed, you can resize your cluster later through the Portal (**Cluster** -> **Settings** -> **Scale Cluster**) to increase or decrease the number of worker nodes.  This resizing can be useful for idling down the cluster when not in use, or for adding capacity to meet the needs of larger tasks.
   >
   >

   Some factors to keep in mind when sizing your cluster, the data nodes, and the edge node include:  

   * The performance of distributed R Server analyses on Spark is proportional to the number of worker nodes when the data is large.  

   * The performance of R Server analyses is linear in the size of data being analyzed. For example:  

     * For small to modest data, performance is best when analyzed in a local compute context on the edge node.  For more information on the scenarios under which the local and Spark compute contexts work best, see  Compute context options for R Server on HDInsight.<br>
     * If you log in to the edge node and run your R script, then all but the ScaleR rx-functions are executed <strong>locally</strong> on the edge node. So the memory and number of cores of the edge node should be sized accordingly. The same applies if you use R Server on HDI as a remote compute context from your laptop.

     ![Node pricing tiers blade](./media/r-server-get-started/pricingtier.png)

     Use the **Select** button to save the node pricing configuration.

   There is also a link for **Download template and parameters**. Click on this link to display scripts that can be used to automate the creation of a cluster with the selected configuration. These scripts are also available from the Azure portal entry for your cluster once it has been created.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It takes some time for the cluster to be created, usually around 20 minutes. Use the tile on the Startboard, or the **Notifications** entry on the left of the page to check on the creation process.

## Connect to RStudio Server

If you’ve chosen to include RStudio Server community edition in your installation, then you can access the RStudio login via two different methods.

1. Go to the following URL (where **CLUSTERNAME** is the name of the cluster you've created):

    https://**CLUSTERNAME**.azurehdinsight.net/rstudio/

2. Open the entry for your cluster in the Azure portal, select the **R Server Dashboards** quick link and then selecting the **R Studio Dashboard**:

     ![Access the R studio dashboard](./media/r-server-get-started/rstudiodashboard1.png)

     ![Access the R studio dashboard](./media/r-server-get-started/rstudiodashboard2.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Regardless of the method used, the first time you log in you need to authenticate twice.  At the first authentication, provide the *cluster Admin userid* and *password*. At the second prompt, provide the *SSH userid* and *password*. Subsequent log ins only require the *SSH password* and *userid*.

<a name="connect-to-edge-node"></a>
## Connect to the R Server edge node

Connect to R Server edge node of the HDInsight cluster using SSH with the command:

   `ssh USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net`

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the `USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net` address in the Azure portal by selecting your cluster then **All Settings** -> **Apps** -> **RServer**. This displays the SSH Endpoint information for the edge node.
>
> ![Image of the SSH Endpoint for the edge node](./media/r-server-get-started/sshendpoint.png)
>
>

If you used a password to secure your SSH user account, you are prompted to enter it. If you used a public key, you may have to use the `-i` parameter to specify the matching private key. For example:

	ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net

For more information, see [Connect to HDInsight (Hadoop) using SSH](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md).

Once connected, you arrive at a prompt similar to the following:

	sername@ed00-myrser:~$

<a name="enable-concurrent-users"></a>
## Enable multiple concurrent users

You can enable multiple concurrent users by adding more users for the edge node on which the RStudio community version runs.

When you create an HDInsight cluster, you must provide two users, an HTTP user and an SSH user:

![Concurrent user 1](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-1.png)

- **Cluster login username**: an HTTP user for authentication through the HDInsight gateway that is used to protect the HDInsight clusters you created. This HTTP user is used to access the Ambari UI, YARN UI, as well as other UI components.
- **Secure Shell (SSH) username**: an SSH user to access the cluster through secure shell. This user is a user in the Linux system for all the head nodes, worker nodes, and edge nodes. So you can use secure shell to access any of the nodes in a remote cluster.

The R Studio Server Community version used in the Microsoft R Server on HDInsight type cluster accepts only Linux username and password as a login mechanism. It does not support passing tokens. So if you have created a new cluster and want to use R Studio to access it, you need to log in twice.

- First log in using the HTTP user credentials through the HDInsight Gateway: 

	![Concurrent user 2a](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-2a.png)

- Then use the SSH user credentials to log in to RStudio:
  
	![Concurrent user 2b](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-2b.png)

Currently, only one SSH user account can be created when provisioning an HDInsight cluster. So to enable multiple users to access Microsoft R Server on HDInsight clusters, we need to create additional users in the Linux system.

Because RStudio Server Community is running on the cluster’s edge node, there are several steps here:

1. Use the created SSH user to log in to the edge node
2. Add more Linux users in edge node
3. Use RStudio Community version with the user created

### Step 1: Use the created SSH user to log in to the edge node

Download any SSH tool (such as Putty) and use the existing SSH user to log in. Then follow the instructions provided in [Connect to HDInsight (Hadoop) using SSH](../hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md) to access the edge node. The edge node address for R Server on HDInsight cluster is:
*clustername-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net*


### Step 2: Add more Linux users in edge node

To add a user to the edge node, execute the commands:

	sudo useradd yournewusername -m
	sudo passwd yourusername

You should see the following items returned: 

![Concurrent user 3](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-3.png)

When prompted for “Current Kerberos password:”, just press **Enter** to ignore it. The `-m` option in `useradd` command indicates that the system will create a home folder for the user, which is required for RStudio Community version.


### Step 3: Use RStudio Community version with the user created

Use the user created to log in to RStudio:

![Concurrent user 4](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-4.png)

Notice that RStudio indicates that you are using the new user (here, for example, *sshuser6*) to log in the cluster: 

![Concurrent user 5](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-5.png)

You can also log in using the original credentials (by default, it is *sshuser*) concurrently from another browser window.

You can submit a job using scaleR functions. Here is an example of the commands used to run a job:

	# Set the HDFS (WASB) location of example data.
	bigDataDirRoot <- "/example/data"

	# Create a local folder for storaging data temporarily.
	source <- "/tmp/AirOnTimeCSV2012"
	dir.create(source)

	# Download data to the tmp folder.
	remoteDir <- "http://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets/AirOnTimeCSV2012"
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201201.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201201.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201202.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201202.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201203.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201203.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201204.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201204.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201205.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201205.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201206.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201206.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201207.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201207.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201208.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201208.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201209.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201209.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201210.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201210.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201211.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201211.csv"))
	download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201212.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201212.csv"))

	# Set directory in bigDataDirRoot to load the data.
	inputDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirOnTimeCSV2012")

	# Create the directory.
	rxHadoopMakeDir(inputDir)

	# Copy the data from source to input.
	rxHadoopCopyFromLocal(source, bigDataDirRoot)

	# Define the HDFS (WASB) file system.
	hdfsFS <- RxHdfsFileSystem()

	# Create info list for the airline data.
	airlineColInfo <- list(
	DAY_OF_WEEK = list(type = "factor"),
	ORIGIN = list(type = "factor"),
	DEST = list(type = "factor"),
	DEP_TIME = list(type = "integer"),
	ARR_DEL15 = list(type = "logical"))

	# Get all the column names.
	varNames <- names(airlineColInfo)

	# Define the text data source in HDFS.
	airOnTimeData <- RxTextData(inputDir, colInfo = airlineColInfo, varsToKeep = varNames, fileSystem = hdfsFS)

	# Define the text data source in local system.
	airOnTimeDataLocal <- RxTextData(source, colInfo = airlineColInfo, varsToKeep = varNames)

	# Specify the formula to use.
	formula = "ARR_DEL15 ~ ORIGIN + DAY_OF_WEEK + DEP_TIME + DEST"

	# Define the Spark compute context.
	mySparkCluster <- RxSpark()

	# Set the compute context.
	rxSetComputeContext(mySparkCluster)

	# Run a logistic regression.
	system.time(
		modelSpark <- rxLogit(formula, data = airOnTimeData)
	)

	# Display a summary.
	summary(modelSpark)


Notice that the jobs submitted are under different user names in YARN UI:

![Concurrent user 6](./media/r-server-get-started/concurrent-users-6.png)

Note also that the newly added users do not have root privileges in Linux system, but they do have the same access to all the files in the remote HDFS and WASB storage.


<a name="use-r-console"></a>
## Use the R console

1. From the SSH session, use the following command to start the R console:  

		R

2. You should see output similar to the following:
	
		R version 3.2.2 (2015-08-14) -- "Fire Safety"
		Copyright (C) 2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
		Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

	Type 'readme()' for release notes.
	>

3. From the `>` prompt, you can enter R code. R server includes packages that allow you to easily interact with Hadoop and run distributed computations. For example, use the following command to view the root of the default file system for the HDInsight cluster:

		rxHadoopListFiles("/")

4. You can also use the WASB style addressing.

		rxHadoopListFiles("wasb:///")


## Using R Server on HDI from a remote instance of Microsoft R Server or Microsoft R Client

It is possible to set up access to the HDI Hadoop Spark compute context from a remote instance of Microsoft R Server or Microsoft R Client running on a desktop or laptop. See **Using Microsoft R Server as a Hadoop Client** subsection in the [Creating a Compute Context for Spark](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/scaler-spark-getting-started.md). To do so, you need to specify the following options when defining the RxSpark compute context on your laptop: hdfsShareDir, shareDir, sshUsername, sshHostname, sshSwitches, and sshProfileScript. For example:


    myNameNode <- "default"
    myPort <- 0

    mySshHostname  <- 'rkrrehdi1-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net'  # HDI secure shell hostname
    mySshUsername  <- 'remoteuser'# HDI SSH username
    mySshSwitches  <- '-i /cygdrive/c/Data/R/davec'   # HDI SSH private key

    myhdfsShareDir <- paste("/user/RevoShare", mySshUsername, sep="/")
    myShareDir <- paste("/var/RevoShare" , mySshUsername, sep="/")

    mySparkCluster <- RxSpark(
      hdfsShareDir = myhdfsShareDir,
      shareDir     = myShareDir,
      sshUsername  = mySshUsername,
      sshHostname  = mySshHostname,
      sshSwitches  = mySshSwitches,
      sshProfileScript = '/etc/profile',
      nameNode     = myNameNode,
      port         = myPort,
      consoleOutput= TRUE
    )


## Use a compute context

A compute context allows you to control whether computation is performed locally on the edge node or distributed across the nodes in the HDInsight cluster.

1. From RStudio Server or the R console (in an SSH session), use the following code to load example data into the default storage for HDInsight:

        # Set the HDFS (WASB) location of example data
        bigDataDirRoot <- "/example/data"

        # create a local folder for storaging data temporarily
        source <- "/tmp/AirOnTimeCSV2012"
        dir.create(source)

        # Download data to the tmp folder
        remoteDir <- "http://packages.revolutionanalytics.com/datasets/AirOnTimeCSV2012"
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201201.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201201.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201202.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201202.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201203.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201203.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201204.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201204.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201205.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201205.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201206.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201206.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201207.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201207.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201208.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201208.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201209.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201209.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201210.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201210.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201211.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201211.csv"))
        download.file(file.path(remoteDir, "airOT201212.csv"), file.path(source, "airOT201212.csv"))

        # Set directory in bigDataDirRoot to load the data into
        inputDir <- file.path(bigDataDirRoot,"AirOnTimeCSV2012")

        # Make the directory
        rxHadoopMakeDir(inputDir)

        # Copy the data from source to input
        rxHadoopCopyFromLocal(source, bigDataDirRoot)

2. Next, let's create some data info and define two data sources so that we can work with the data.

        # Define the HDFS (WASB) file system
        hdfsFS <- RxHdfsFileSystem()

        # Create info list for the airline data
        airlineColInfo <- list(
             DAY_OF_WEEK = list(type = "factor"),
             ORIGIN = list(type = "factor"),
             DEST = list(type = "factor"),
             DEP_TIME = list(type = "integer"),
             ARR_DEL15 = list(type = "logical"))

        # get all the column names
        varNames <- names(airlineColInfo)

        # Define the text data source in hdfs
        airOnTimeData <- RxTextData(inputDir, colInfo = airlineColInfo, varsToKeep = varNames, fileSystem = hdfsFS)

        # Define the text data source in local system
        airOnTimeDataLocal <- RxTextData(source, colInfo = airlineColInfo, varsToKeep = varNames)

        # formula to use
        formula = "ARR_DEL15 ~ ORIGIN + DAY_OF_WEEK + DEP_TIME + DEST"

3. Let's run a logistic regression over the data using the local compute context.

        # Set a local compute context
        rxSetComputeContext("local")

        # Run a logistic regression
        system.time(
           modelLocal <- rxLogit(formula, data = airOnTimeDataLocal)
        )

        # Display a summary
        summary(modelLocal)

    You should see output that ends with lines similar to the following:

        Data: airOnTimeDataLocal (RxTextData Data Source)
        File name: /tmp/AirOnTimeCSV2012
        Dependent variable(s): ARR_DEL15
        Total independent variables: 634 (Including number dropped: 3)
        Number of valid observations: 6005381
        Number of missing observations: 91381

4. Next, let's run the same logistic regression using the Spark context. The Spark context distributes the processing over all the worker nodes in the HDInsight cluster.

        # Define the Spark compute context
        mySparkCluster <- RxSpark()

        # Set the compute context
        rxSetComputeContext(mySparkCluster)

        # Run a logistic regression
        system.time(  
           modelSpark <- rxLogit(formula, data = airOnTimeData)
        )
        
        # Display a summary
        summary(modelSpark)


   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also use MapReduce to distribute computation across cluster nodes. For more information on compute context, see [Compute context options for R Server on HDInsight](r-server-compute-contexts.md).


## Distribute R code to multiple nodes

With R Server, you can easily take existing R code and run it across multiple nodes in the cluster by using `rxExec`. This function is useful when doing a parameter sweep or simulations. The following code is an example of how to use `rxExec`:

	rxExec( function() {Sys.info()["nodename"]}, timesToRun = 4 )

If you are still using the Spark or MapReduce context, this  command returns the nodename value for the worker nodes that the code `(Sys.info()["nodename"])` is run on. For example, on a four node cluster, you expect to receive output similar to the following:

    $rxElem1
        nodename
    "wn3-myrser"

    $rxElem2
        nodename
    "wn0-myrser"

    $rxElem3
        nodename
    "wn3-myrser"

    $rxElem4
        nodename
    "wn3-myrser"


## Accessing Data in Hive and Parquet

A feature available in R Server 9.1 allows direct access to data in Hive and Parquet for use by ScaleR functions in the Spark compute context. These capabilities are available through new ScaleR data source functions called RxHiveData and RxParquetData that work through use of Spark SQL to load data directly into a Spark DataFrame for analysis by ScaleR.  

The following code provides some sample code on use of the new functions:

    #Create a Spark compute context:
    myHadoopCluster <- rxSparkConnect(reset = TRUE)

    #Retrieve some sample data from Hive and run a model:
    hiveData <- RxHiveData("select * from hivesampletable",
                     colInfo = list(devicemake = list(type = "factor")))
    rxGetInfo(hiveData, getVarInfo = TRUE)

    rxLinMod(querydwelltime ~ devicemake, data=hiveData)

    #Retrieve some sample data from Parquet and run a model:
    rxHadoopMakeDir('/share')
    rxHadoopCopyFromLocal(file.path(rxGetOption('sampleDataDir'), 'claimsParquet/'), '/share/')
    pqData <- RxParquetData('/share/claimsParquet',
                     colInfo = list(
    		    age    = list(type = "factor"),
    		   car.age = list(type = "factor"),
    		      type = list(type = "factor")
    		 ) )
    rxGetInfo(pqData, getVarInfo = TRUE)

    rxNaiveBayes(type ~ age + cost, data = pqData)

    #Check on Spark data objects, cleanup, and close the Spark session:
    lsObj <- rxSparkListData() # two data objs are cached
    lsObj
    rxSparkRemoveData(lsObj)
    rxSparkListData() # it should show empty list
    rxSparkDisconnect(myHadoopCluster)


For additional info on use of these new functions see the online help in R Server through use of the `?RxHivedata` and `?RxParquetData` commands.  


## Install additional R packages on the edge node

If you would like to install additional R packages on the edge node, you can use `install.packages()` directly from within the R console when connected to the edge node through SSH. However, if you need to install R packages on the worker nodes of the cluster, you must use a Script Action.

Script Actions are Bash scripts that are used to make configuration changes to the HDInsight cluster or to install additional software, such as additional R packages. To install additional packages using a Script Action, use the following steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Script Actions to install additional R packages can only be used after the cluster has been created. Do not use this procedure during cluster creation, as the script relies on R Server being completely installed and configured.
>
>

1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your R Server on HDInsight cluster.

2. From the **Settings** blade, select **Script Actions** and then **Submit New** to submit a new Script Action.

   ![Image of script actions blade](./media/r-server-get-started/scriptaction.png)

3. From the **Submit script action** blade, provide the following information:

   * **Name**: A friendly name to identify this script

   * **Bash script URI**: `http://mrsactionscripts.blob.core.windows.net/rpackages-v01/InstallRPackages.sh`

   * **Head**: This item should be **unchecked**

   * **Worker**: This item should be **checked**

   * **Edge nodes**: This item should be **unchecked**.

   * **Zookeeper**: This item should be **unchecked**

   * **Parameters**: The R packages to be installed. For example, `bitops stringr arules`

   * **Persist this script...**: This item should be **Checked**  

   > [!NOTE]
   > 1. By default, all R packages are installed from a snapshot of the Microsoft MRAN repository consistent with the version of R Server that has been installed. If you want to install newer versions of packages, then there is some risk of incompatibility. However this kind of install is possible by specifying `useCRAN` as the first element of the package list, for example `useCRAN bitops, stringr, arules`.  
   > 2. Some R packages require additional Linux system libraries. For convenience, we have pre-installed the dependencies needed by the top 100 most popular R packages. However, if the R package(s) you install require libraries beyond these then you must download the base script used here and add steps to install the system libraries. You must then upload the modified script to a public blob container in Azure storage and use the modified script to install the packages.
   >    For more information on developing Script Actions, see [Script Action development](../hdinsight-hadoop-script-actions-linux.md).  
   >
   >

   ![Adding a script action](./media/r-server-get-started/submitscriptaction.png)

4. Select **Create** to run the script. Once the script completes, the R packages are available on all worker nodes.


## Using Microsoft R Server Operationalization

When your data modeling is complete, you can operationalize the model to make predictions. To configure for Microsoft R Server operationalization, perform the following steps:

First, ssh into the Edge node. For example, 

	ssh -L USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net

After using ssh, change directory for the relevant version and sudo the dotnet dll: 

- For Microsoft R Server 9.1:

	cd /usr/lib64/microsoft-r/rserver/o16n/9.1.0
	sudo dotnet Microsoft.RServer.Utils.AdminUtil/Microsoft.RServer.Utils.AdminUtil.dll

- For Microsoft R Server 9.0:

	cd /usr/lib64/microsoft-deployr/9.0.1
	sudo dotnet Microsoft.DeployR.Utils.AdminUtil/Microsoft.DeployR.Utils.AdminUtil.dll

To configure Microsoft R Server operationalization with a One-box configuration do the following:

1. Select “Configure R Server for Operationalization”
2. Select “A. One-box (web + compute nodes)”
3. Enter a password for the **admin** user

![one box op](./media/r-server-get-started/admin-util-one-box-.png)

As an optional step you can perform Diagnostic checks by running a diagnostic test as follows:

1. Select “6. Run diagnostic tests”
2. Select “A. Test configuration”
3. Enter Username = “admin” and password from previous configuration step
4. Confirm Overall Health = pass
5. Exit the Admin Utility
6. Exit SSH

![Diagnostic for op](./media/r-server-get-started/admin-util-diagnostics.png)


>[!NOTE]
>**Long delays when consuming web service on Spark**
>
>If you encounter long delays when trying to consume a web service created with mrsdeploy functions in a Spark compute context, you may need to add some missing folders. The Spark application belongs to a user called '*rserve2*' whenever it is invoked from a web service using mrsdeploy functions. To work around this issue:

	# Create these required folders for user 'rserve2' in local and hdfs:

	hadoop fs -mkdir /user/RevoShare/rserve2
	hadoop fs -chmod 777 /user/RevoShare/rserve2

	mkdir /var/RevoShare/rserve2
	chmod 777 /var/RevoShare/rserve2


	# Next, create a new Spark compute context:
 
	rxSparkConnect(reset = TRUE)


At this stage, the configuration for Operationalization is complete. Now you can use the ‘mrsdeploy’ package on your RClient to connect to the Operationalization on edge node and start using its features like [remote execution](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/operationalize/remote-execution) and [web-services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy-websrv-vignette). Depending on whether your cluster is set up on a virtual network or not, you may need to set up port forward tunneling through SSH login. The following sections explain how to set up this tunnel.

### RServer Cluster on virtual network

Make sure you allow traffic through port 12800 to the edge node. That way, you can use the edge node to connect to the Operationalization feature.


	library(mrsdeploy)

	remoteLogin(
    	deployr_endpoint = "http://[your-cluster-name]-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:12800",
    	username = "admin",
    	password = "xxxxxxx"
	)


If the `remoteLogin()` cannot connect to the edge node, but you can SSH to the edge node, then you need to verify whether the rule to allow traffic on port 12800 has been set properly or not. If you continue to face the issue, you can work around it by setting up port forward tunneling through SSH. For instructions, see the following section.

### RServer Cluster not set up on virtual network

If your cluster is not set up on vnet or if you are having troubles with connectivity through vnet, you can use SSH port forward tunneling:

	ssh -L localhost:12800:localhost:12800 USERNAME@CLUSTERNAME-ed-ssh.azurehdinsight.net

On Putty, you can set it up as well.

![putty ssh connection](./media/r-server-get-started/putty.png)

Once your SSH session is active, the traffic from your machine’s port 12800 is forwarded to the edge node’s port 12800 through SSH session. Make sure you use `127.0.0.1:12800` in your `remoteLogin()` method. This logs in to the edge node’s operationalization through port forwarding.


	library(mrsdeploy)

	remoteLogin(
    	deployr_endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:12800",
    	username = "admin",
    	password = "xxxxxxx"
	)


## How to scale Microsoft R Server Operationalization compute nodes on HDInsight worker nodes

### Decommission the worker node(s)

Microsoft R Server is currently not managed through Yarn. If the worker nodes are not decommissioned, the Yarn Resource Manager will not work as expected because it will not be aware of the resources being taken up by the server. In order to avoid this situation, we recommend decommissioning the worker nodes before you scale out the compute nodes.

Steps to decommissioning worker nodes:

* Log in to HDI cluster's Ambari console and click on "hosts" tab
* Select worker nodes (to be decommissioned), Click on "Actions" > "Selected Hosts" > "Hosts" > click on "Turn ON Maintenance Mode". For example, in the following image we have selected wn3 and wn4 to decommission.  

   ![decommission worker nodes](./media/r-server-get-started/get-started-operationalization.png)  

* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > **DataNodes** > click **Decommission**
* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > **NodeManagers** > click **Decommission**
* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > **DataNodes** > click **Stop**
* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > **NodeManagers** > click on **Stop**
* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > **Hosts** > click **Stop All Components**
* Unselect the worker nodes and select the head nodes
* Select **Actions** > **Selected Hosts** > "**Hosts** > **Restart All Components**

###	Configure Compute nodes on each decommissioned worker node(s)

1. SSH into each decommissioned worker node.
2. Run admin utility using `dotnet /usr/lib64/microsoft-deployr/9.0.1/Microsoft.DeployR.Utils.AdminUtil/Microsoft.DeployR.Utils.AdminUtil.dll`.
3. Enter "1" to select option "Configure R Server for Operationalization".
4. Enter "c" to select option "C. Compute node". This configures the compute node on the worker node.
5. Exit the Admin Utility.

### Add compute nodes details on Web Node

Once all decommissioned worker nodes have been configured to run compute node, come back on the edge node and add decommissioned worker nodes' IP addresses in the Microsoft R Server web node's configuration:

* SSH into the edge node.
* Run `vi /usr/lib64/microsoft-deployr/9.0.1/Microsoft.DeployR.Server.WebAPI/appsettings.json`.
* Look for the "URIs" section, and add worker node's IP and port details.
