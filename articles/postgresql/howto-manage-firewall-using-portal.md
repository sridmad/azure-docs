# Create and manage Azure Database for PostgreSQL firewall rules using the Azure portal
Server-level firewall rules enable administrators to access an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Server from a specified IP address or range of IP addresses. 

## Prerequisites
To step through this how-to guide, you need:
- A server [Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL](quickstart-create-server-database-portal.md)

## Create a server-level firewall rule in the Azure portal
1. On the PostgreSQL server page, under Settings heading, click **Connection security** to open the Connection security page for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

2. Select **Add My IP** on the toolbar. This action automatically creates a firewall rule with the public IP address of your computer, as perceived by the Azure system.

3. Verify your IP address before saving the configuration. In some situations, the IP address observed by Azure portal differs from the IP address used when accessing the internet and Azure servers. Therefore, you may need to change the Start IP and End IP to make the rule function as expected.
Use a search engine or other online tool to check your own IP address (for example, Bing search "what is my IP").

4. Add additional address ranges. In the firewall rules for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL, you can specify a single IP address, or a range of addresses. If you want to limit the rule to a single IP address, type the same address in the field for Start IP and End IP. Opening the firewall enables administrators, users, and applications to log in to any database on the PostgreSQL server to which they have valid credentials.

5. Click **Save** on the toolbar to save this server-level firewall rule. Wait for the confirmation that the update to the firewall rules was successful.

## Manage existing server-level firewall rules through the Azure portal
Repeat the steps to manage the firewall rules.
* To add the current computer, click the button to + **Add My IP**. Click **Save** to save the changes.
* To add additional IP addresses, type in the Rule Name, Start IP Address, and End IP Address. Click **Save** to save the changes.
* To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule and modify. Click **Save** to save the changes.
* To delete an existing rule, click the ellipsis [â€¦] and click **Delete** to remove the rule. Click **Save** to save the changes.
