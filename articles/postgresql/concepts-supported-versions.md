# Supported PostgreSQL Database Versions
Microsoft aims to support n-2 versions of the PostgreSQL engine in the Azure Database for PostgreSQL service, meaning the currently released major version (n) and the two prior major versions (-2).

Azure Database for PostgreSQL currently supports the following versions:

## PostgreSQL Version 9.6.2
Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/release-9-6-2.html) to learn more about improvements and fixes in PostgreSQL 9.6.2.

## PostgreSQL Version 9.5.7
Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/release-9-5-7.html) to learn about improvements and fixes in PostgreSQL 9.5.7.

## Managing updates and upgrades
Azure Database for PostgreSQL automatically manages patching for minor version updates. Currently, in public preview, major version upgrade is not supported. For example, upgrading from PostgreSQL 9.5 to PostgreSQL 9.6 is not supported.

## Next steps
For information about the support of different PostgreSQL extensions, see [PostgreSQL Extensions](concepts-extensions.md)
