Azure Application Gateway is a dedicated virtual appliance that provides application delivery controller (ADC) as a service, offering various layer 7 load-balancing capabilities for your application.

## CLI versions

You can create an application gateway by using one of the following command-line interface (CLI) versions:

* [Azure CLI 1.0](application-gateway-create-gateway-cli-nodejs.md): Azure CLI for the classic and Azure Resource Manager deployment models
* [Azure CLI 2.0](application-gateway-create-gateway-cli.md): Next-generation CLI for the Resource Manager deployment model

## Prerequisite: Install the Azure CLI 2.0

To perform the steps in this article, you need to [install the Azure CLI for macOS, Linux, and Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-az-cli2).

> [!NOTE]
> You need an Azure account to create an application gateway. If you don't have one, sign up for a [free trial](../active-directory/sign-up-organization.md).

## Scenario

In this scenario, you learn how to create an application gateway by using the Azure portal.

This scenario will:

* Create a medium application gateway with two instances.
* Create a virtual network named AdatumAppGatewayVNET with a reserved CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.
* Create a subnet called Appgatewaysubnet that uses 10.0.0.0/28 as its CIDR block.

> [!NOTE]
> Further configuration of the application gateway, including custom health probes, back-end pool addresses, and additional rules, happens after the application gateway is created and not during initial deployment.

## Before you begin

An application gateway requires its own subnet. When you're creating a virtual network, ensure that you leave enough address space for multiple subnets. After you deploy an application gateway to a subnet, you can add only additional application gateways to that subnet.

## Sign in to Azure

Open the **Microsoft Azure Command Prompt** and sign in:

```azurecli-interactive
az login -u "username"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use `az login` without the switch for device login that requires entering a code at aka.ms/devicelogin.

After you enter the preceding command, you'll receive a code. Go to https://aka.ms/devicelogin in a browser to continue the sign-in process.

![Cmd showing device login][1]

In the browser, enter the code you received. This redirects you to a sign-in page.

![Browser to enter code][2]

Enter the code to sign in, and then close the browser to continue.

![Successfully signed in][3]

## Create the resource group

Before you create the application gateway, create a resource group to contain it. Use the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myresourcegroup --location "eastus"
```

## Create the application gateway

Use the back-end IP addresses for your back-end server IP addresses. These values can be either private IPs in the virtual network, public IPs, or fully qualified domain names for your back-end servers. The following example creates an application gateway with additional configurations for HTTP settings, ports, and rules:

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway create \
--name "AdatumAppGateway" \
--location "eastus" \
--resource-group "myresourcegroup" \
--vnet-name "AdatumAppGatewayVNET" \
--vnet-address-prefix "10.0.0.0/16" \
--subnet "Appgatewaysubnet" \
--subnet-address-prefix "10.0.0.0/28" \
--servers 10.0.0.4 10.0.0.5 \
--capacity 2 \
--sku Standard_Small \
--http-settings-cookie-based-affinity Enabled \
--http-settings-protocol Http \
--frontend-port 80 \
--routing-rule-type Basic \
--http-settings-port 80 \
--public-ip-address "pip2" \
--public-ip-address-allocation "dynamic" \

```

The preceding example shows several properties that are not required during the creation of an application gateway. The following code example creates an application gateway with the required information:

```azurecli-interactive
az network application-gateway create \
--name "AdatumAppGateway" \
--location "eastus" \
--resource-group "myresourcegroup" \
--vnet-name "AdatumAppGatewayVNET" \
--vnet-address-prefix "10.0.0.0/16" \
--subnet "Appgatewaysubnet" \
--subnet-address-prefix "10.0.0.0/28" \
--servers "10.0.0.5"  \
--public-ip-address pip
```
 
> [!NOTE]
> For a list of parameters to use during creation, run the following command: `az network application-gateway create --help`.

This example creates a basic application gateway with default settings for the listener, back-end pool, back-end HTTP settings, and rules. You can modify these settings to suit your deployment after the provisioning is successful.

If the web application was defined with the back-end pool in the preceding steps, load balancing begins now.

## Get the application gateway DNS name
After you create the gateway, you then configure the front end for communication. When you're using a public IP, the application gateway requires a dynamically assigned DNS name, which is not friendly. To ensure users can hit the application gateway, use a CNAME record to point to the public endpoint of the application gateway. For more information, see [Use Azure DNS to provide custom domain settings for an Azure service](../dns/dns-custom-domain.md).

To configure an alias, retrieve details of the application gateway and its associated IP/DNS name by using the PublicIPAddress element attached to the application gateway. Use the application gateway's DNS name to create a CNAME record, which points the two web applications to this DNS name. Don't use A records because the VIP might change on restart of the application gateway.


```azurecli-interactive
az network public-ip show --name "pip" --resource-group "AdatumAppGatewayRG"
```

```
