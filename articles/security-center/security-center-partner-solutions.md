# Managing connected partner solutions with Azure Security Center
This article walks you through how to manage and monitor connected security solutions in Azure Security Center.

## Monitoring partner solutions
To monitor the health status of connected security solutions and perform basic management:

1. Under **Security Center - Overview**, select **Security solutions**.

  ![Select security solutions][1]

  The **Connected solutions** section includes security solutions that are connected to Security Center and information about the health status of each solution.

  ![Partner solutions][2]

   The status of a partner solution can be:

   * Healthy (green) - there is no health issue.
   * Unhealthy (red) - there is a health issue that requires immediate attention.
   * Health issues (orange) - the solution has stopped reporting its health.
   * Not reported (gray) - the solution has not reported anything yet, a solution's status may be unreported if it has recently been connected and is still deploying, or no health data is available.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If health status data is not available, Security Center shows the date and time of the last event received to indicate whether the solution is reporting or not. If no health data is available and no alerts are received within the last 14 days, Security Center indicates that the solution is unhealthy or not reporting.
   >
   >

2. Select **VIEW** for additional information and options, which includes:

  - **Solution console**. Opens the management experience for this solution.
  - **Link VM**. Opens the Link Applications blade. Here you can connect resources to the partner solution.
  - **Delete solution**.
  - **Configure**.
