# Protecting your applications in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations that guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.  Recommendations apply to Azure resource types: virtual machines (VMs), networking, SQL, and applications.

This article addresses recommendations that apply to applications.  Application recommendations center around deployment of a web application firewall.  Use the table below as a reference to help you understand the available application recommendations and what each one does if you apply it.

## Available application recommendations
| Recommendation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Add a web application firewall](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md) |Recommends that you deploy a web application firewall (WAF) for web endpoints. A WAF recommendation is shown for any public facing IP (either Instance Level IP or Load Balanced IP) that has an associated network security group with open inbound web ports (80,443).</br></br>Security Center recommends that you provision a WAF to help defend against attacks targeting your web applications on virtual machines and on App Service Environment. An App Service Environment (ASE) is a [Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) service plan option of Azure App Service that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running Azure App Service apps. To learn more about ASE, see the [App Service Environment Documentation](../app-service/environment/intro.md).</br></br>You can protect multiple web applications in Security Center by adding these applications to your existing WAF deployments. |
| [Finalize application protection](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md#finalize-application-protection) |To complete the configuration of a WAF, traffic must be rerouted to the WAF appliance. Following this recommendation completes the necessary setup changes. |
