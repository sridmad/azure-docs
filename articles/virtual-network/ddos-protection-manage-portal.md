# Manage Azure DDoS Protection Standard using the Azure portal

Learn how to enable and disable distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection, and use telemetry to mitigate a DDoS attack with Azure DDoS Protection Standard. DDoS Protection Standard protects Azure resources such as virtual machines, load balancers, and application gateways that have an Azure [public IP address](virtual-network-public-ip-address.md) assigned to it. To learn more about DDoS Protection Standard and its capabilities, see [DDoS Protection Standard overview](ddos-protection-overview.md). 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Azure DDoS Protection Standard (DDoS Protection) is currently in preview. A limited number of Azure resources support DDoS Protection, and it's available only in a select number of regions. For a list of available regions, see [DDoS Protection Standard overview](ddos-protection-overview.md). You need to [register for the service](http://aka.ms/ddosprotection) during the limited preview to get DDoS Protection enabled for your subscription. After registering, you are contacted by the Azure DDoS team who will guide you through the enablement process. 

## Enable DDoS Protection Standard - New virtual network

1. Log in to the Azure portal at http://portal.azure.com. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
2. Click the **New** button found on the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.
3. Select **Networking**, and then select **Virtual Network**.
4. Create a virtual network with your chosen settings. For more information about creating virtual networks, see [Create a virtual network](virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md). Under *DDoS protection*, click **Enabled**, and then click **Create**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > When selecting a region, choose a supported region from the list in [Azure DDoS Protection Standard overview](ddos-protection-overview.md).

    A warning states that enabling DDoS Protection incurs charges. No charges for DDoS Protection are incurred during preview. Charges will incur at general availability. You will receive 30 days notice, prior to the start of charges and general availability.

## Enable DDoS Protection Standard - Existing virtual network 

1. Click **Virtual networks** in the Azure portal menu, and then select your virtual network.
2. Click **DDoS Protection**, click **Enabled** on the *DDoS Protection* screen, and then click **Save**. 

    > [!WARNING]
    > The virtual network must exist in a supported region. For a list of supported regions, see [Azure DDoS Protection Standard overview](ddos-protection-overview.md).

    A warning states that enabling DDoS Protection incurs charges. No charges for DDoS Protection are incurred during preview. Charges will incur at general availability. You will receive 30 days notice, prior to the start of charges and general availability.

## Disable DDoS Protection on a virtual network

1. Click **Virtual networks** in the Azure portal menu, and then select your virtual network.
2. Click **DDoS Protection**, click **Disabled** on the *DDoS Protection* screen, and then click **Save**.

## Configure alerts on DDoS Protection metrics

You can select any of the available DDoS Protection metrics to alert when there’s an active mitigation during an attack using the Azure Monitor alert configuration. When the conditions are met, the address specified receives an alert email.

1. Click **Monitor**, and then click **Metrics**.
2. On the *Metrics* screen, select the resource group, resource type of **Public IP Address**, and your Azure public IP address.
3. To configure an email alert for a metric, click **Add metric alert**. An email alert can be created on any metric, but the most obvious metric is **Under DDoS attack or not**. This is a boolean value 1 or 0. A **1** means you are under attack. A **0** means you are not under attack.
4. To be emailed when under attack, set the metric for **Under DDoS attack or not** and **Condition to Greater than zero (0) over the last 5 minutes**. Similar alerts can be set up for other metrics.

    ![Configure metrics](./media/ddos-protection-manage-portal/ddos-metrics.png)

    Within a few minutes of attack detection, you are notified using Azure Monitor metrics.

You can also learn more about [configuring webhooks](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-webhooks-alerts.md) and [logic apps](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md) for creating alerts.

## Configure logging on DDoS Protection Standard metrics

1. Click **Monitor**, and then click **Diagnostic Settings**.
2. On the *Metrics* screen, select the resource group, resource type of **Public IP Address**, and your Azure public IP address.
3. Click **Turn on diagnostics to collect the following data**.

There are three options available for logging:

- **Archive to a storage account**: Writes logs to a storage account.
- **Stream to an event hub**: Allows a log receiver to pick up logs using an event hub. This enables integration with Splunk or other SIEM systems.
- **Send to Log Analytics**: Writes logs to the Azure OMS Log Analytics service.

## Use DDoS Protection telemetry

Telemetry for an attack is provided through Azure Monitor in real-time. The telemetry is available only for the duration that a public IP address is under mitigation. You will not see telemetry before or after an attack is mitigated.

1. Click **Monitor**, and then click **Metrics**. 
2. On the *Metrics* screen, select the resource group, resource type of **Public IP Address**, and your Azure public IP address. A series of **Available Metrics** appears on the left side of the screen. These metrics, when selected, are graphed in the **Azure Monitor Metrics Chart** on the overview screen. 

The metric names present different packet types, and bytes vs. packets, with a basic construct of tag names on each metric as follows:

- **Dropped tag name (e.g. Inbound Packets Dropped DDoS)**: The number of packets dropped/scrubbed by the DDoS protection system.
- **Forwarded tag name (e.g: Inbound Packets Forwarded DDoS)**: The number of packets forwarded by the DDoS system to the destination VIP – traffic that was not filtered.
- **No tag name (e.g:  Inbound Packets DDoS):** The total number of packets that came into the scrubbing system – representing the sum of the packets dropped and forwarded.
