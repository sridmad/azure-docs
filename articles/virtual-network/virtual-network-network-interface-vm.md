# Add network interfaces to or remove from virtual machines

Learn how to add an existing network interface when creating a VM or add or remove network interfaces from an existing VM in the stopped (deallocated) state. A network interface enables an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to communicate with Internet, Azure, and on-premises resources. A VM can have one or more network interfaces. 

If you need to add, change, or remove IP addresses for a network interface, read the [Manage network interface IP addresses](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md) article. If you need to create, change, or delete network interfaces, read the [Manage network interfaces](virtual-network-network-interface.md) article.

## <a name="before"></a>Before you begin

Complete the following tasks before completing any steps in any section of this article:

- Learn about how many network interfaces each Linux and Windows VM size supports by reviewing the [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles.
- Log in to the Azure [portal](https://portal.azure.com), Azure command-line interface (CLI), or Azure PowerShell with an Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, sign up for a [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).
- If using PowerShell commands to complete tasks in this article, [install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). Ensure you have the most recent version of the Azure PowerShell commandlets installed. To get help for PowerShell commands, with examples, type `get-help <command> -full`.
- If using Azure command-line interface (CLI) commands to complete tasks in this article, [install and configure the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). Ensure you have the most recent version of the Azure CLI installed. To get help for CLI commands, type `az <command> --help`. Rather than installing the CLI and its pre-requisites, you can use the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. To use the Cloud Shell, click the Cloud Shell **>_** button at the top of the [portal](https://portal.azure.com).

## <a name="about"></a>About network interfaces and VMs

You can add (attach) an existing network interface to a VM when you create the VM, provided the network interface isn't currently attached to another VM. You can add a network interface to, or remove (detach) a network interface to from an existing VM, provided the VM is in the stopped (deallocated) state. If you create a VM using the Azure portal, the portal creates a network interface for you with default settings. The portal does not allow you to:

- Specify an existing network interface to add when creating the VM
- Create a VM with multiple network interfaces
- Specify a name for the network interface (the portal creates the network interface with a default name)

You can use Azure PowerShell or the CLI to create a network interface or VM with all the previous attributes that you cannot use the portal for. Before completing the tasks in the following sections, consider the following constraints and behaviors:

- All VM sizes support at least two network interfaces, but some VM sizes support more than two network interfaces. In the past, some VM sizes only supported one network interface. To learn how many network interfaces each VM size supports, read the [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles. 
- In the past, network interfaces could only be added to VMs that supported multiple network interfaces and were created with at least two network interfaces. You could not add a network interface to a VM that was created with one network interface, even if the VM size supported multiple network interfaces. Conversely, you could only remove network interfaces from a VM with at least three network interfaces, because VMs created with at least two network interfaces always had to have at least two network interfaces. Neither of these constraints apply anymore. You can now create a VM with any number of network interfaces (up to the number supported by the VM size) and add or remove any number of network interfaces (from VMs in the stopped (deallocated) state), as long as the VM always has at least one network interface.
- By default, the first network interface in a VM is defined as the *primary* network interface. All other network interfaces in the VM are *secondary* network interfaces.
- Primary network interfaces are assigned a default gateway by the Azure DHCP servers, but secondary network interfaces are not. Since secondary network interfaces aren't assigned a default gateway, they cannot communicate with resources outside of their subnet, by default. To enable secondary network interfaces to communicate with resources outside their subnet, see [Routing within a virtual machine operating system with multiple network interfaces](#routing-within-a-virtual-machine-operating-system-with-multiple-network-interfaces).
- By default, all outbound traffic from the VM is sent out the IP address assigned to the primary IP configuration of the primary network interface. You control which IP address is used for outbound traffic within the VM's operating system, but by default, it's through the primary network interface.
- In the past, all VMs within the same availability set were required to have a single, or multiple, network interfaces. VMs with any number of network interfaces can now exist in the same availability set, up to the number supported by the VM size. You can only add a VM to an availability set when it's created though. To learn more about availability sets, read the [Manage the availability of VMs in Azure](../virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#configure-multiple-virtual-machines-in-an-availability-set-for-redundancy) article.
- While network interfaces in the same VM can be connected to different subnets within a VNet, the network interfaces must all be connected to the same VNet.
- You can add any IP address for any IP configuration of any primary or secondary network interface to an Azure Load Balancer back-end pool. In the past, only the primary IP address for the primary network interface could be added to a back-end pool. To learn more about IP addresses and configurations, read the [Add, change, or remove IP addresses](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md) article.
- Deleting a VM does not delete the network interfaces that are attached to it. When a VM is deleted, the network interfaces are detached from the VM. You can add the network interfaces to different VMs, or delete them.
- If a network interface has a private IPv6 address assigned to it, you can attach it to a VM when creating the VM. You cannot attach a network interface with an assigned IPv6 address to a VM after the VM is created. If you attach a network interface with an assigned private IPv6 address when creating a virtual machine, you can only attach that network interface to the virtual machine, regardless of how many network interfaces the VM size supports. See [Network interface IP addresses](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md) to learn more about assigning IP addresses to network interfaces.

## <a name="vm-create"></a>Add existing network interfaces to a new VM

When you create a VM through the portal, the portal creates a network interface with default settings and attaches it to the VM for you. You cannot add existing network interfaces to a new VM, or create a VM with multiple network interfaces, using the Azure portal. You can do both using the CLI or PowerShell. You can add as many network interfaces to a VM as the VM size you're creating supports. To learn more about how many network interfaces each VM size supports, read the [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles. The network interfaces you add to a VM cannot currently be attached to another VM. To learn more about creating network interfaces, read the [Manage network interfaces](virtual-network-network-interface.md#create-a-network-interface) article.

### Routing within a virtual machine operating system with multiple network interfaces

Azure assigns a default gateway to the first (primary) network interface attached to the virtual machine. Azure does not assign a default gateway to additional (secondary) network interfaces attached to a virtual machine. Therefore, you are unable to communicate with resources outside the subnet that a secondary network interface is in, by default. Secondary network interfaces can, however, communicate with resources outside their subnet, though the steps to enable communication are different for different operating systems.

### Windows

Complete the following steps from a Windows command prompt:

1. Run the `route print` command, which returns output similar to the following output for a virtual machine with two attached network interfaces:

    ```
    ===========================================================================
    Interface List
    3...00 0d 3a 10 92 ce ......Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #3
    7...00 0d 3a 10 9b 2a ......Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #4
    ===========================================================================
    ```
 
    In this example, **Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter #4** (interface 7) is the secondary network interface that doesn't have a default gateway assigned to it.

2. From a command prompt, run the `ipconfig` command to see which IP address is assigned to the secondary network interface. In this example, 192.168.2.4 is assigned to interface 7. No default gateway address is returned for the secondary network interface.

3. To route all traffic destined for addresses outside the subnet of the secondary network interface to the gateway for the subnet, run the following command:

    ```
    route add -p 0.0.0.0 MASK 0.0.0.0 192.168.2.1 METRIC 5015 IF 7
    ```

    The gateway address for the subnet is the first IP address (ending in .1) in the address range defined for the subnet. If you don't want to route all traffic outside the subnet, you could add individual routes to specific destinations, instead. For example, if you only wanted to route traffic from the secondary network interface to the 192.168.3.0 network, you enter the command:

      ```
      route add -p 192.168.3.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1 METRIC 5015 IF 7
      ```
  
4. To confirm successful communication with a resource on the 192.168.3.0 network, for example, enter the following command to ping 192.168.3.4 using interface 7 (192.168.2.4):

    ```
    ping 192.168.3.4 -S 192.168.2.4
    ```

    You may need to open ICMP through the Windows firewall of the device you're pinging with the following command:
  
      ```
      netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=Allow-ping protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow
      ```
  
5. To confirm the added route is in the route table, enter the `route print` command, which returns output similar to the following text:

    ```
    ===========================================================================
    Active Routes:
    Network Destination        Netmask          Gateway       Interface  Metric
              0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.1.1      192.168.1.4     15
              0.0.0.0          0.0.0.0      192.168.2.1      192.168.2.4   5015
    ```

    The route listed with *192.168.1.1* under **Gateway**, is the route that is there by default for the primary network interface. The route with *192.168.2.1* under **Gateway**, is the route you added.

### Linux

Since the default behavior uses weak host routing, we recommend restricting secondary network interface traffic between resources in the same subnet. If you require communication outside the subnet for secondary network interfaces, you must create routing rules that allow the virtual machine to send and receive traffic through a specific network interface. Otherwise, traffic that belongs to eth1, for example, cannot be processed correctly by the defined default route. To learn how to configure routing rules, see [Configure Linux for multiple NICs](../virtual-machines/linux/multiple-nics.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#configure-guest-os-for-multiple-nics).

> [!WARNING]
> If a network interface has a private IPv6 address assigned to it, you can only add the network interface to the virtual machine when creating the virtual machine. You cannot attach more than one network interface to the virtual machine when you create the virtual machine, or after the virtual machine is created, as long as an IPv6 address is assigned to a network interface attached to a virtual machine. See [Network interface IP addresses](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md) to learn more about assigning IP addresses to network interfaces.

## <a name="vm-add-nic"></a>Add an existing network interface to an existing VM

You can add as many network interfaces to a VM as the VM size you're adding network interfaces to supports. To learn how many network interfaces each VM size supports, read the [Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles. The VM you want to add a network interface to must support the number of network interfaces you want to add and must be in the stopped (deallocated) state. The network interfaces you want to add cannot currently be attached to another VM. You cannot add network interfaces to an existing VM using the Azure portal. To add network interfaces to an existing VM, you must use the CLI or PowerShell. 

Azure assigns a default gateway to the first (primary) network interface attached to the virtual machine. Azure does not assign a default gateway to additional (secondary) network interfaces attached to a virtual machine. Therefore, you are unable to communicate with resources outside the subnet that a secondary network interface is in, by default. Secondary network interfaces can, however, communicate with resources outside their subnet. If you require that your secondary network interfaces communication with resources outside their subnet, see [Routing within a virtual machine operating system with multiple network interfaces](#routing-within-a virtual-machine-operating-system-with-multiple-network-interfaces).

> [!WARNING]
> If a network interface has a private IPv6 address assigned to it, it cannot be added to an existing virtual machine. You can only add a network interface with an assigned private IPv6 address to a virtual machine when you create a virtual machine.

## <a name="vm-remove-nic"></a> Remove a network interface from a VM

The VM you want to remove (or detach) a network interface from must be in the stopped (deallocated) state and must currently have at least two network interfaces attached to it. You can remove any network interface, but the VM must always have at least one network interface attached to it. If you remove a primary network interface, Azure assigns the primary attribute to the network interface that's been attached to the VM the longest. 

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor role for your subscription. To learn more about assigning roles to accounts, see [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor).
