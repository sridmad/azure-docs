# Create a virtual network peering - different deployment models, same subscription 

In this tutorial, you learn to create a virtual network peering between virtual networks created through different deployment models. Both virtual networks exist in the same subscription. Peering two virtual networks enables resources in different virtual networks to communicate with each other with the same bandwidth and latency as though the resources were in the same virtual network. Learn more about [Virtual network peering](virtual-network-peering-overview.md). 

The steps to create a virtual network peering are different, depending on whether the virtual networks are in the same, or different, subscriptions, and which [Azure deployment model](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) the virtual networks are created through. Learn how to create a virtual network peering in other scenarios by clicking the scenario from the following table:

|Azure deployment model  | Azure subscription  |
|--------- |---------|
|[Both Resource Manager](virtual-network-create-peering.md) |Same|
|[Both Resource Manager](create-peering-different-subscriptions.md) |Different|
|[One Resource Manager, one classic](create-peering-different-deployment-models-subscriptions.md) |Different|

A virtual network peering cannot be created between two virtual networks deployed through the classic deployment model. If you need to connect virtual networks that were both created through the classic deployment model, you can use an Azure [VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) to connect the virtual networks. 

This tutorial peers virtual networks in the same region. The ability to peer virtual networks in different regions is currently in preview. Complete the steps in [Register for global virtual network peering](#register) before attempting to peer virtual networks in different regions, or the peering fails. The ability to connect virtual networks in different regions with an Azure [VPN Gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-vnet-vnet-resource-manager-portal.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) is generally available, and does not require registration.

You can use the [Azure portal](#portal), the Azure [command-line interface](#cli) (CLI), Azure [PowerShell](#powershell), or an [Azure Resource Manager template](#template) to create a virtual network peering. Click any of the previous tool links to go directly to the steps for creating a virtual network peering using your tool of choice.

## Create peering - Azure portal

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). The account you log in with must have the necessary permissions to create a virtual network peering. See the [Permissions](#permissions) section of this article for details.
2. Click **+ New**, click **Networking**, then click **Virtual network**.
3. In the **Create virtual network** blade, enter, or select values for the following settings, then click **Create**:
    - **Name**: *myVnet1*
    - **Address space**: *10.0.0.0/16*
    - **Subnet name**: *default*
    - **Subnet address range**: *10.0.0.0/24*
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
    - **Resource group**: Select **Create new** and enter *myResourceGroup*
    - **Location**: *East US*
4. Click **+ New**. In the **Search the Marketplace** box, type *Virtual network*. Click **Virtual network** when it appears in the search results. 
5. In the **Virtual network** blade, select **Classic** in the **Select a deployment model** box, and then click **Create**.
6. In the **Create virtual network** blade, enter, or select values for the following settings, then click **Create**:
    - **Name**: *myVnet2*
    - **Address space**: *10.1.0.0/16*
    - **Subnet name**: *default*
    - **Subnet address range**: *10.1.0.0/24*
    - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
    - **Resource group**: Select **Use existing** and select *myResourceGroup*
    - **Location**: *East US*
7. In the **Search resources** box at the top of the portal, type *myResourceGroup*. Click **myResourceGroup** when it appears in the search results. A blade appears for the **myresourcegroup** resource group. The resource group contains the two virtual networks created in previous steps.
8. Click **myVNet1**.
9. In the **myVnet1** blade that appears, click **Peerings** from the vertical list of options on the left side of the blade.
10. In the **myVnet1 - Peerings** blade that appeared, click **+ Add**
11. In the **Add peering** blade that appears, enter, or select the following options, then click **OK**:
     - **Name**: *myVnet1ToMyVnet2*
     - **Virtual network deployment model**:  Select **Classic**. 
     - **Subscription**: Select your subscription
     - **Virtual network**:  Click **Choose a virtual network**, then click **myVnet2**.
     - **Allow virtual network access:** Ensure that **Enabled** is selected.
    No other settings are used in this tutorial. To learn about all peering settings, read [Manage virtual network peerings](virtual-network-manage-peering.md#create-a-peering).
12. After clicking **OK** in the previous step, the **Add peering** blade closes and you see the **myVnet1 - Peerings** blade again. After a few seconds, the peering you created appears in the blade. **Connected** is listed in the **PEERING STATUS** column for the **myVnet1ToMyVnet2** peering you created.

    The peering is now established. Any Azure resources you create in either virtual network are now able to communicate with each other through their IP addresses. If you're using default Azure name resolution for the virtual networks, the resources in the virtual networks are not able to resolve names across the virtual networks. If you want to resolve names across virtual networks in a peering, you must create your own DNS server. Learn how to set up [Name resolution using your own DNS server](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-using-your-own-dns-server).
13. **Optional**: Though creating virtual machines is not covered in this tutorial, you can create a virtual machine in each virtual network and connect from one virtual machine to the other, to validate connectivity.
14. **Optional**: To delete the resources that you create in this tutorial, complete the steps in the [Delete resources](#delete-portal) section of this article.

## <a name="cli"></a>Create peering - Azure CLI

1. [Install](../cli-install-nodejs.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) the Azure CLI 1.0 to create the virtual network (classic).
2. Open a command session and log in to Azure using the `azure login` command.
3. Run the CLI in Service Management mode by entering the `azure config mode asm` command.
4. Enter the following command to create the virtual network (classic):
 
    ```azurecli
    azure network vnet create --vnet myVnet2 --address-space 10.1.0.0 --cidr 16 --location "East US"
    ```

5. Create a resource group and a virtual network (Resource Manager). You can use either the CLI 1.0 or 2.0 ([install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json)). In this tutorial, the CLI 2.0 is used to create the virtual network (Resource Manager), since 2.0 must be used to create the peering. Execute the following bash CLI script from your local machine with the CLI 2.0.4 or later installed. For options on running bash CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/cli-options.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json). You can also run the script using the Azure Cloud Shell. The Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Click the **Try it** button in the script that follows, which invokes a Cloud Shell that logs you can log in to your Azure account with. To execute the script, click the **Copy** button and paste, the contents into your Cloud Shell, then press `Enter`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    #!/bin/bash

    # Create a resource group.
    az group create \
      --name myResourceGroup \
      --location eastus

    # Create the virtual network (Resource Manager).
    az network vnet create \
      --name myVnet1 \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --location eastus \
      --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16
    ```

6. Create a virtual network peering between the two virtual networks created through the different deployment models. Copy the following script to a text editor on your PC. Replace `<subscription id>` with your subscription Id. If you don't know your subscription Id, enter the `az account show` command. The value for **id** in the output is your subscription Id. Paste the modified script in to your CLI session, and then press `Enter`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    # Get the id for VNet1.
    vnet1Id=$(az network vnet show \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --name myVnet1 \
      --query id --out tsv)

    # Peer VNet1 to VNet2.
    az network vnet peering create \
      --name myVnet1ToMyVnet2 \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --vnet-name myVnet1 \
      --remote-vnet-id /subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourceGroups/Default-Networking/providers/Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/myVnet2 \
      --allow-vnet-access
    ```
7. After the script executes, review the peering for the virtual network (Resource Manager). Copy the following command, paste it in your CLI session, and then press `Enter`:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az network vnet peering list \
      --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --vnet-name myVnet1 \
      --output table
    ```
    
    The output shows **Connected** in the **PeeringState** column. 

    Any Azure resources you create in either virtual network are now able to communicate with each other through their IP addresses. If you're using default Azure name resolution for the virtual networks, the resources in the virtual networks are not able to resolve names across the virtual networks. If you want to resolve names across virtual networks in a peering, you must create your own DNS server. Learn how to set up [Name resolution using your own DNS server](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-using-your-own-dns-server).
8. **Optional**: Though creating virtual machines is not covered in this tutorial, you can create a virtual machine in each virtual network and connect from one virtual machine to the other, to validate connectivity.
9. **Optional**: To delete the resources that you create in this tutorial, complete the steps in [Delete resources](#delete-cli) in this article.

## <a name="powershell"></a>Create peering - PowerShell

1. Install the latest version of the PowerShell [Azure](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Azure) and [AzureRm](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM/) modules. If you're new to Azure PowerShell, see [Azure PowerShell overview](/powershell/azure/overview?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
2. Start a PowerShell session.
3. In PowerShell, log in to Azure by entering the `Add-AzureAccount` command.
4. To create a virtual network (classic) with PowerShell, you must create a new, or modify an existing, network configuration file. Learn how to [export, update, and import network configuration files](virtual-networks-using-network-configuration-file.md). The file should include the following **VirtualNetworkSite** element for the virtual network used in this tutorial:

    ```xml
    <VirtualNetworkSite name="myVnet2" Location="East US">
      <AddressSpace>
        <AddressPrefix>10.1.0.0/16</AddressPrefix>
      </AddressSpace>
      <Subnets>
        <Subnet name="default">
          <AddressPrefix>10.1.0.0/24</AddressPrefix>
        </Subnet>
      </Subnets>
    </VirtualNetworkSite>
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > Importing a changed network configuration file can cause changes to existing virtual networks (classic) in your subscription. Ensure you only add the previous virtual network and that you don't change or remove any existing virtual networks from your subscription. 
5. Log in to Azure to create the virtual network (Resource Manager) by entering the `login-azurermaccount` command. The account you log in with must have the necessary permissions to create a virtual network peering. See the [Permissions](#permissions) section of this article for details.
6. Create a resource group and a virtual network (Resource Manager). Copy the script, paste it into PowerShell, and then press `Enter`.

    ```powershell
    # Create a resource group.
      New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location eastus

    # Create the virtual network (Resource Manager).
      $vnet1 = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork `
      -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
      -Name 'myVnet1' `
      -AddressPrefix '10.0.0.0/16' `
      -Location eastus
    ```

7. Create a virtual network peering between the two virtual networks created through the different deployment models. Copy the following script to a text editor on your PC. Replace `<subscription id>` with your subscription Id. If you don't know your subscription Id, enter the `Get-AzureRmSubscription` command to view it. The value for **Id** in the returned output is your subscription ID. To execute the script, copy the modified script from your text editor, then right-click in your PowerShell session, and then press `Enter`.

    ```powershell
    # Peer VNet1 to VNet2.
    Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkPeering `
      -Name myVnet1ToMyVnet2 `
      -VirtualNetwork $vnet1 `
      -RemoteVirtualNetworkId /subscriptions/<subscription Id>/resourceGroups/Default-Networking/providers/Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/myVnet2
    ```

8. After the script executes, review the peering for the virtual network (Resource Manager). Copy the following command, paste it in your PowerShell session, and then press `Enter`:

    ```powershell
    Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkPeering `
      -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup `
      -VirtualNetworkName myVnet1 `
      | Format-Table VirtualNetworkName, PeeringState
    ```

    The output shows **Connected** in the **PeeringState** column.

    Any Azure resources you create in either virtual network are now able to communicate with each other through their IP addresses. If you're using default Azure name resolution for the virtual networks, the resources in the virtual networks are not able to resolve names across the virtual networks. If you want to resolve names across virtual networks in a peering, you must create your own DNS server. Learn how to set up [Name resolution using your own DNS server](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md#name-resolution-using-your-own-dns-server).

9. **Optional**: Though creating virtual machines is not covered in this tutorial, you can create a virtual machine in each virtual network and connect from one virtual machine to the other, to validate connectivity.
10. **Optional**: To delete the resources that you create in this tutorial, complete the steps in [Delete resources](#delete-powershell) in this article.
 
## <a name="permissions"></a>Permissions

The accounts you use to create a virtual network peering must have the necessary role or permissions. For example, if you were peering two virtual networks named myVnet1 and myVnet2, your account must be assigned the following minimum role or permissions for each virtual network:
    
|Virtual network|Deployment model|Role|Permissions|
|---|---|---|---|
|myVnet1|Resource Manager|[Network Contributor](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor)|Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/virtualNetworkPeerings/write|
| |Classic|[Classic Network Contributor](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#classic-network-contributor)|N/A|
|myVnet2|Resource Manager|[Network Contributor](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor)|Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/peer|
||Classic|[Classic Network Contributor](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#classic-network-contributor)|Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks/peer|

Learn more about [built-in roles](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) and assigning specific permissions to [custom roles](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-custom-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) (Resource Manager only).

## <a name="delete"></a>Delete resources
When you've finished this tutorial, you might want to delete the resources you created in the tutorial, so you don't incur usage charges. Deleting a resource group also deletes all resources that are in the resource group.

### <a name="delete-portal"></a>Azure portal

1. In the portal search box, enter **myResourceGroup**. In the search results, click **myResourceGroup**.
2. On the **myResourceGroup** blade, click the **Delete** icon.
3. To confirm the deletion, in the **TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME** box, enter **myResourceGroup**, and then click **Delete**.

### <a name="delete-cli"></a>Azure CLI

1. Use the Azure CLI 2.0 to delete the virtual network (Resource Manager) with the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
    ```

2. Use the Azure CLI 1.0 to delete the virtual network (classic) with the following commands:

    ```azurecli
    azure config mode asm

    azure network vnet delete --vnet myVnet2 --quiet
    ```

### <a name="delete-powershell"></a>PowerShell

1. Enter the following command to delete the virtual network (Resource Manager):

    ```powershell
    Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
    ```

2. To delete the virtual network (classic) with PowerShell, you must modify an existing network configuration file. Learn how to [export, update, and import network configuration files](virtual-networks-using-network-configuration-file.md).

    ```xml
    <VirtualNetworkSite name="myVnet2" Location="East US">
      <AddressSpace>
        <AddressPrefix>10.1.0.0/16</AddressPrefix>
      </AddressSpace>
      <Subnets>
        <Subnet name="default">
          <AddressPrefix>10.1.0.0/24</AddressPrefix>
        </Subnet>
      </Subnets>
    </VirtualNetworkSite>
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > Importing a changed network configuration file can cause changes to existing virtual networks (classic) in your subscription. Ensure you only remove the previous virtual network and that you don't change or remove any other existing virtual networks from your subscription. 

## <a name="register"></a>Register for the global virtual network peering preview

The ability to peer virtual networks in different regions is currently in preview. The capability is available in a limited set of regions (initially, US West Central, Canada Central, and US West 2). Virtual network peerings created between virtual networks in different regions may not have the same level of availability and reliability as a peering between virtual networks in the same region. For the most up-to-date notifications on availability and status of this feature, check the [Azure Virtual Network updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=virtual-network) page.

To peer virtual networks across regions, you must first register for the preview, by completing the following steps (within the subscription each virtual network you want to peer is in) using Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI:

### PowerShell

1. Install the latest version of the PowerShell [AzureRm](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM/) module. If you're new to Azure PowerShell, see [Azure PowerShell overview](/powershell/azure/overview?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json).
2. Start a PowerShell session and log in to Azure using the `Login-AzureRmAccount` command.
3. Register the subscription that each virtual network you want to peer is in for the preview by entering the following commands:

    ```powershell
    Register-AzureRmProviderFeature `
      -FeatureName AllowGlobalVnetPeering `
      -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
    
    Register-AzureRmResourceProvider `
      -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
    ```
4. Confirm that you are registered for the preview by entering the following command:

    ```powershell    
    Get-AzureRmProviderFeature `
      -FeatureName AllowGlobalVnetPeering `
      -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
    ```

    Do not complete the steps in the Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or Resource Manager template sections of this article until the **RegistrationState** output you receive after entering the previous command is **Registered** for both subscriptions.

### Azure CLI

1. [Install and configure the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?toc=%2Fazure%2Fvirtual-network%2Ftoc.json).
2. Ensure you are using version 2.0.18 or higher of the Azure CLI by entering the `az --version` command. If you are not, install the most recent version.
3. Log in to Azure with the `az login` command.
4. Register for the preview by entering the following commands:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az feature register --name AllowGlobalVnetPeering --namespace Microsoft.Network
    az provider register --name Microsoft.Network
    ```

5. Confirm that you are registered for the preview by entering the following command:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az feature show --name AllowGlobalVnetPeering --namespace Microsoft.Network
    ```

    Do not complete the steps in the Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or Resource Manager template sections of this article until the **RegistrationState** output you receive after entering the previous command is **Registered** for both subscriptions.
