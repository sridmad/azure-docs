# Advisor Cost recommendations

Advisor helps you optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend by identifying idle and underutilized resources.Â You can get cost recommendations from the **Cost** tab on the Advisor dashboard.

## Optimize virtual machine spend by resizing or shutting down underutilized instances 
Although certain application scenarios can result in low utilization by design, you can often save money by managing the size and number of your virtual machines. Advisor monitors your virtual machine usage for 14 days and then identifies low-utilization virtual machines. Virtual machines whose CPU utilization is 5 percent or less and network usage is 7 MB or less for four or more days are considered low-utilization virtual machines.

Advisor shows you the estimated cost of continuing to run your virtual machine, so that you can choose to shut it down or resize it.

If you want to be more aggressive at identifying underutilized virtual machines, you can adjust the average CPU utilization rule on a per subscription basis.

## Use a cost effective solution to manage performance goals of multiple SQL databases
Advisor identifies SQL server instances that can benefit from creating elastic database pools. Elastic database pools provide a simple, cost-effective solution to manage the performance goals of multiple databases that have varying usage patterns. For more information about Azure elastic pools, see [What is an Azure Elastic pool?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-pool/).

## Reduce costs by eliminating unprovisioned ExpressRoute circuits
Advisor identifies ExpressRoute circuits that have been in the provider status of *Not Provisioned* for more than one month, and recommends deleting the circuit if you aren't planning to provision the circuit with your connectivity provider.
