Network security group flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that enables you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a network security group. These flow logs are written in JSON format and provide important information, including: 

- Outbound and inbound flows on a per-rule basis.
- The NIC that the flow applies to.
- 5-tuple information about the flow (source/destination IP, source/destination port, protocol).
- Information about whether traffic was allowed or denied.

## Before you begin

This scenario assumes you have already followed the steps in [Create a Network Watcher instance](network-watcher-create.md). The scenario also assumes that a you have a resource group with a valid virtual machine.

## Register Insights provider

For flow logging to work successfully, the **Microsoft.Insights** provider must be registered. To register the provider, take the following steps: 

1. Go to **Subscriptions**, and then select the subscription for which you want to enable flow logs. 
2. On the **Subscription** blade, select **Resource Providers**. 
3. Look at the list of providers, and verify that the **microsoft.insights** provider is registered. If not, then select **Register**.
