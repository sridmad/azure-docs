# Analyze your Virtual Machine security with Security Group View using Azure CLI 1.0

Security group view returns configured and effective network security rules that are applied to a virtual machine. This capability is useful to audit and diagnose Network Security Groups and rules that are configured on a VM to ensure traffic is being correctly allowed or denied. In this article, we show you how to retrieve the configured and effective security rules to a virtual machine using Azure CLI

This article uses cross-platform Azure CLI 1.0, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Network Watcher currently uses Azure CLI 1.0 for CLI support.

## Before you begin

This scenario assumes you have already followed the steps in [Create a Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md) to create a Network Watcher.

## Scenario

The scenario covered in this article retrieves the configured and effective security rules for a given virtual machine.

## Get a VM

A virtual machine is required to run the `vm list` cmdlet. The following command lists the virtual machinese in a resource group:

```azurecli
azure vm list -g resourceGroupName
```

Once you know the virtual machine, you can use the `vm show` cmdlet to get its resource Id:

```azurecli
azure vm show -g resourceGroupName -n virtualMachineName
```

## Retrieve security group view

The next step is to retrieve the security group view result. Adding the "--json" flag will format the results in json.

```azurecli
azure network watcher security-group-view -g resourceGroupName -n networkWatcherName -t targetResourceId --json
```

## Viewing the results

The following example is a shortened response of the results returned. The results show all the effective and applied security rules on the virtual machine broken down in groups of **NetworkInterfaceSecurityRules**, **DefaultSecurityRules**, and **EffectiveSecurityRules**.

```json

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
