# Introduction to flow logging for Network Security Groups

Network Security Group flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a Network Security Group. These flow logs are written in json format and show outbound and inbound flows on a per rule basis, the NIC the flow applies to, 5-tuple information about the flow (Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port, Protocol), and if the traffic was allowed or denied.

![flow logs overview][1]

While flow logs target Network Security Groups, they are not displayed the same as the other logs. Flow logs are stored only within a storage account and following the logging path as shown in the following example:

```
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resourceId%3D/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/microsoft.network/networksecuritygroups/{nsgName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/PT1H.json
```

The same retention policies as seen on other logs apply to flow logs. Logs have a retention policy that can be set from 1 day to 365 days. If a retention policy is not set, the logs are maintained forever.

## Log file

Flow logs have multiple properties. The following list is a listing of the properties that are returned within the NSG flow log:

* **time** - Time when the event was logged
* **systemId** - Network Security Group resource Id.
* **category** - The category of the event, this is always be NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvent
* **resourceid** - The resource Id of the NSG
* **operationName** - Always NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvents
* **properties** - A collection of properties of the flow
	* **Version** - Version number of the Flow Log event schema
	* **flows** - A collection of flows. This property has multiple entries for different rules
		* **rule** - Rule for which the flows are listed
			* **flows** - a collection of flows
				* **mac** - The MAC address of the NIC for the VM where the flow was collected
				* **flowTuples** - A string that contains multiple properties for the flow tuple in comma-separated format
					* **Time Stamp** - This value is the time stamp of when the flow occurred in UNIX EPOCH format
					* **Source IP** - The source IP
					* **Destination IP** - The destination IP
					* **Source Port** - The source port
					* **Destination Port** - The destination Port
					* **Protocol** - The protocol of the flow. Valid values are **T** for TCP and **U** for UDP
					* **Traffic Flow** - The direction of the traffic flow. Valid values are **I** for inbound and **O** for outbound.
					* **Traffic** - Whether traffic was allowed or denied. Valid values are **A** for allowed and **D** for denied.


The following is an example of a Flow log. As you can see there are multiple records that follow the property list described in the preceding section. 

> [!NOTE]
> Values in the flowTuples property are a comma-separated list.
