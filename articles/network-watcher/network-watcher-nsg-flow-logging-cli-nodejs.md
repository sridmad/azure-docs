# Configuring Network Security Group Flow logs with Azure CLI 1.0

Network Security Group flow logs are a feature of Network Watcher that allows you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic through a Network Security Group. These flow logs are written in json format and show outbound and inbound flows on a per rule basis, the NIC the flow applies to, 5-tuple information about the flow (Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port, Protocol), and if the traffic was allowed or denied.

This article uses cross-platform Azure CLI 1.0, which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Network Watcher currently uses Azure CLI 1.0 for CLI support.

## Register Insights provider

In order for flow logging to work successfully, the **Microsoft.Insights** provider must be registered. If you are not sure if the **Microsoft.Insights** provider is registered, run the following script.

```azurecli
azure provider register --namespace Microsoft.Insights --subscription <subscriptionid>
```

## Enable Network Security Group Flow logs

The command to enable flow logs is shown in the following example:

```azurecli
azure network watcher configure-flow-log -g resourceGroupName -n networkWatcherName -t nsgId -i storageAccountId -e true
```

## Disable Network Security Group Flow logs

Use the following example to disable flow logs:

```azurecli
azure network watcher configure-flow-log -g resourceGroupName -n networkWatcherName -t nsgId -i storageAccountId -e false
```

## Download a Flow log

The storage location of a flow log is defined at creation. A convenient tool to access these flow logs saved to a storage account is Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer, which can be downloaded here:  http://storageexplorer.com/

If a storage account is specified, packet capture files are saved to a storage account at the following location:

```
https://{storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/insights-logs-networksecuritygroupflowevent/resourceId%3D/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/microsoft.network/networksecuritygroups/{nsgName}/{year}/{month}/{day}/PT1H.json
```
