# How to use PowerShell to manage Azure Files
You can use Azure PowerShell to create and manage file shares.

## Install the PowerShell cmdlets for Azure Storage
To prepare to use PowerShell, download and install the Azure PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) for the install point and installation instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended that you download and install or upgrade to the latest Azure PowerShell module.
> 
> 

Open an Azure PowerShell window by clicking **Start** and typing **Windows PowerShell**. The PowerShell window loads the Azure Powershell module for you.

## Create a context for your storage account and key
Create the storage account context. The context encapsulates the storage account name and account key. For instructions on copying your account key from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), see [View and copy storage access keys](../common/storage-create-storage-account.md?toc=%2fazure%2fstorage%2ffiles%2ftoc.json#view-and-copy-storage-access-keys).

Replace `storage-account-name` and `storage-account-key` with your storage account name and key in the following example.

```powershell
# create a context for account and key
$ctx=New-AzureStorageContext storage-account-name storage-account-key
```

## Create a new file share
Create the new share, named `logs`.

```powershell
# create a new share
$s = New-AzureStorageShare logs -Context $ctx
```

You now have a file share in File storage. Next we'll add a directory and a file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The name of your file share must be all lowercase. For complete details about naming file shares and files, see [Naming and Referencing Shares, Directories, Files, and Metadata](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn167011.aspx).

## Create a directory in the file share
Create a directory in the share. In the following example, the directory is named `CustomLogs`.

```powershell
# create a directory in the share
New-AzureStorageDirectory -Share $s -Path CustomLogs
```

## Upload a local file to the directory
Now upload a local file to the directory. The following example uploads a file from `C:\temp\Log1.txt`. Edit the file path so that it points to a valid file on your local machine.

```powershell
# upload a local file to the new directory
Set-AzureStorageFileContent -Share $s -Source C:\temp\Log1.txt -Path CustomLogs
```

## List the files in the directory
To see the file in the directory, you can list all of the directory's files. This command returns the files and subdirectories (if there are any) in the CustomLogs directory.

```powershell
# list files in the new directory
Get-AzureStorageFile -Share $s -Path CustomLogs | Get-AzureStorageFile
```

Get-AzureStorageFile returns a list of files and directories for whatever directory object is passed in. "Get-AzureStorageFile -Share $s" returns a list of files and directories in the root directory. To get a list of files in a subdirectory, you have to pass the subdirectory to Get-AzureStorageFile. That's what this does -- the first part of the command up to the pipe returns a directory instance of the subdirectory CustomLogs. Then that is passed into Get-AzureStorageFile, which returns the files and directories in CustomLogs.

## Copy files
Beginning with version 0.9.7 of Azure PowerShell, you can copy a file to another file, a file to a blob, or a blob to a file. Below we demonstrate how to perform these copy operations using PowerShell cmdlets.

```powershell
# copy a file to the new directory
Start-AzureStorageFileCopy -SrcShareName srcshare -SrcFilePath srcdir/hello.txt -DestShareName destshare -DestFilePath destdir/hellocopy.txt -Context $srcCtx -DestContext $destCtx

# copy a blob to a file directory
Start-AzureStorageFileCopy -SrcContainerName srcctn -SrcBlobName hello2.txt -DestShareName hello -DestFilePath hellodir/hello2copy.txt -DestContext $ctx -Context $ctx
```
