# Review operations

Use the Review API's [Review operations](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/580519483f9b0709fc47f9c4) to create image or text reviews within the review tool for human moderation. You would use this operation based on your post-moderation business logic after you have scanned your content using any of the Content Moderator image or text APIs or other Cognitive Services. Once your human moderators have reviewed the auto-assigned tags and prediction data and submitted their final decision, the Review API submits all information to your API endpoint.

## Use the API console
Before you can test-drive the API from the online console, you will need a few values.

- teamName: The team name you created when you set up your review tool account. 
- ContentId: A string, this is passed to the API and returned through the callback, and is useful for associating internal identifiers or metadata with the results of a moderation job.
- Metadata: Custom key value pairs returned to your API endpoint during the callback. Additionally, if the key is a short code defined within the review tool, it shows up as a tag.
- Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: This is found under the **Settings** tab, as shown in the [Overview](overview.md) article.


The simplest way to access a testing console is from the Credentials window.
1.	From the Credentials window, click **[API Reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/580519483f9b0709fc47f9c4)**.

2.	Navigate to the **Review â€“ Create** operation. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under Open API testing console.
