# About Connectors #

Workflows can use other APIs, not just the Content Manager API. However, other APIs first need to be connected to Content Manager using a Connector: the Connector provides a link to the other API.

Content Moderator includes Connectors by default, including these Connectors.

## Verifying your credentials ## 

Before you start defining a workflow, make sure you have valid credentials for the API you intend to use.

1.	Select Connectors from the Settings tab in the Review Tool Dashboard.

## Adding a Connector ##

1.	Before you add a connector, you will need a subscription key. From the Settings > Credentials window, copy the Ocp-Admin-Subscription-Key.

2.	Click Connectors. From the available connectors displayed in the Review Tool Dashboard, click Connect. A window opens, asking for your subscription key.
