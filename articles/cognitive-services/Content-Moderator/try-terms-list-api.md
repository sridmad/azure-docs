# Term lists with the Text Moderation API

The default global list of terms is usually sufficient, but you may need to screen against terms that are specific to your business. For example, you may want to tag competitors’ names for further review. The [Terms List API](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf755e3f9b070c105bd2c2/operations/57cf755e3f9b070868a1f67f) allows you to create custom lists of terms for use with the Text Moderation API. The **Text - Screen** operation scans your text for profanity, comparing it against custom and/or shared blacklists.

You can also create lists of images to be used with the List Moderation API. This tutorial focuses on lists of terms.

The Terms List management API include these operations:
- Create a list.
- Add terms to your list.
- Screen terms against the ones in the list.
- Delete term or terms from the list.
- Delete the list.
- Edit list information.
- Refresh the index so that changes are found during a scan.

## Use the API console
Before you can test-drive the API from the online console, you will need the **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**. This is found under the **Settings** tab, as shown in the [Overview](overview.md) article.

## Creating a term list
1.	Navigate to the [Term list management API reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/57cf755e3f9b070c105bd2c2/operations/57cf755e3f9b070868a1f67f) page.

2.	You land on the **Term Lists > Create** operation. 

3.	Click the button that most closely describes your location, under **Open API testing console**. The **Term Lists – Create** API Console opens.

4.	Enter your subscription key.

5.	In the Request Body, type a **Name** for the term list, and a brief **Description**.
  ![Try Term List API - Create Step 1](images/try-terms-list-create-1.png)

6.	Use the key-value pair placeholders to assign more descriptive metadata to your list. For example, you could enter something on these lines:

        {
           "Name": "MyExclusionList",
           "Description": "MyListDescription",
           "Metadata": 
           {
              "Category": "Competitors",
              "Type": "Exclude"
           }
        }

  Note that we are adding list metadata as key value pairs, not the actual terms.
 
7.	Click Send. Your list is created. Make note of the Id number that is associated with the new list. You will need this for other List Management functions.

  ![Try Term List API - Create Step 2](images/try-terms-list-create-2.png)
 
8.	Now you need to add terms to MyList. On the left, click **Term > Add Term**. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under **Open API testing console**. 
  ![Try Term List Management API Region](images/test-drive-region.png)

9.	The **Term – Add Term** console opens.
 
10.	Enter the **listId** that you have generated above, and select the **language**. Enter your **subscription key** and click **Send**.

  ![Try Term List Management API Step 3](images/try-terms-list-create-3.png)
 
9.	Verify the term has been added by using the **Term > Get All Terms** API. Enter the **listId** and your **subscription key**, and click **Send**.

  ![Try Term List Management API Step 4](images/try-terms-list-create-4.png)
 
10.	Add a few more terms. Now that you have created a custom list of terms, try [scanning some text](try-text-api.md) against it. 

## Deleting terms and lists

Deleting a term or a list is straightforward. The API supports these operations:

- Delete a term. **(Term > Delete)**
- Delete all the terms in a list without deleting the list. **(Term > Delete All Terms)**
- Delete the list and all of its contents. **(Term Lists > Delete)**

This example deletes a single term.

1.	On the left, click **Term > Delete**. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under Open API testing console. 

  ![Try Term List Management API Region](images/test-drive-region.png)
 
  The **Term – Delete API** console opens.
 
2.	Enter the **listId** for the list you are concerned with. This is the number **(122)** that was returned with the **Get Details** API for **MyList**, in the section above. Enter the term and choose a language.

3.	Enter your **subscription key** and click **Send**.

4.	Verify the term has been deleted by using the **Term > Get All Terms** API.

## Changing a list’s information

You can edit a list’s name and description, and add metadata items.

1.	On the left, click **Term Lists > Update** Details. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under **Open API testing console**. The **Term Lists – Update Details** API console opens.

  ![Try Term List Management API Region](images/test-drive-region.png)
 
2.	Enter the **listId** and your **subscription key**.

3.	Make your edits in the **Request Body** field, and click **Send**.

  ![Try Term List Management API Change Step 1](images/try-terms-list-change-1.png)
 
## Refresh Search Index

After you have made changes to a list, its index must be refreshed before subsequent scans will “see” the changes. This is similar to how a search engine on your desktop (if enabled) or a web search engine continually refreshes its index to include new files or pages.

1.	On the left, click **Term Lists > Refresh** Search Index. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under **Open API testing console**. The **Term Lists – Refresh Search Index** API console opens.

  ![Try Term List Management API Region](images/test-drive-region.png)

2.	Enter the **listId** and your **subscription key**, and click **Send**.
