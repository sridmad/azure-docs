# Workflow operations

Use the Review API's [Workflow operations](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/5813b46b3f9b0711b43c4c59) to create or update or get workflow details by using the Review API. You can define simple or complex and even nested expressions for your workflows by using this API. These workflows appear within the review tool for your team and are used by the Review API's Job operations.

## Use the API console
Before you can test-drive the API from the online console, you will need a few values.

- **team**: The team name you created when you set up your review tool account. 
- **workflowname**: The name for your workflow
- **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**: This is found under the **Settings** tab, as shown in the [Overview](overview.md) article.


The simplest way to access a testing console is from the Credentials window.
1.	From the Credentials window, click **[API Reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/580519463f9b070e5c591178/operations/5813b46b3f9b0711b43c4c59)**.

2.	Navigate to the **Review â€“ Create** operation. Click the button that most closely describes your location, under Open API testing console.
