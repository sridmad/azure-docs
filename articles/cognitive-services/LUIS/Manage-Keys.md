# Manage your keys
A key is your passport to the server that allows you to publish your LUIS app to end users. LUIS has two different types of keys:

* **Starter Key or Programmatic Key:** A starter key, also known as a programmatic key, is created automatically for LUIS account and it's free. It gives you 1000 endpoint hits per month so you can start using your LUIS app. It also gives you unlimited hits for authoring and editing your application using the LUIS Programmatic APIs. 
[Click here for a complete API Reference](https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/5890b47c39e2bb17b84a55ff/operations/5890b47c39e2bb052c5b9c2f).
    > [!TIP]
    > To find the Programmatic Key, log in to https://www.luis.ai and click on the account name in the upper-right navigation bar to open **Account Settings**, which displays the Programmatic Key.

* **Endpoint Key(s):** If you need more than 1000 hits per month you can buy a key from the Microsoft Azure portal. It is essential for publishing your app and accessing your HTTP endpoint. This key allows a quota of endpoint hits based on the usage plan you specified when creating the key. See [Cognitive Services Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-understanding-intelligent-services/?v=17.23h) for pricing information.

 
The process of creating and using endpoint keys involves the following tasks:

1. Create a key on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For further instructions, see [Creating a subscription key using Azure](AzureIbizaSubscription.md).
 
2. On the **Publish app** page, click the **Add Key** button to open the **Assign a key to your app** dialog.

3. Select a Tenant ID in the dialog. In Azure, a tenant represents the client or organization associated with a service.

4. Choose the subscription associated with the key you want to add.

5. Select a key associated with the subscription.

## Regions and keys

The region to which you publish your LUIS app corresponds to the region or location you specify in the Azure portal when you create a key. When you [publish an app](./PublishApp.md), LUIS automatically generates an endpoint URL for the region associated with the key. To publish a LUIS app to more than one region, you need at least one key per region. LUIS apps created on https://www.luis.ai can be published to endpoints in the following regions:

 Azure region   |   Endpoint URL format   |   
------|------|
West US     |   https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/YOUR-APP-ID?subscription-key=YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY  |
East US 2     |   https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/YOUR-APP-ID?subscription-key=YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY   |
West Central US     |   https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/YOUR-APP-ID?subscription-key=YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY   |
Southeast Asia     |   https://southeastasia.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/YOUR-APP-ID?subscription-key=YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY   |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you attempt to publish to https://www.luis.ai using a key in the Europe Azure region, LUIS displays a warning message. Instead, use https://eu.luis.ai.

### Publishing to Europe

To publish to the European regions, you can create LUIS apps at https://eu.luis.ai.  

> [!NOTE]
> LUIS apps created at [https://eu.luis.ai](https://eu.luis.ai) don't automatically migrate to [https://www.luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai). You will need to export and then import the LUIS app in order to migrate it.

 Azure region   |   Endpoint URL format   |   
------|------|
West Europe     | https://westeurope.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/YOUR-APP-ID?subscription-key=YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-KEY |

## Reset your Programmatic API key
You can reset your Programmatic API key to get a new one generated for your account.

**To reset a Programmatic API key:**

1. Click **My Keys** on LUIS top navigation bar to access **My Keys** page.

    ![My Keys page](./Images/MyKeys.JPG)
2. At the top of **My Keys** page, you can see your current Programmatic API key. Click **Reset Programmatic API Key**. The new key will be generated replacing the existing one.


## Create and use endpoint keys for your apps
You can create as many endpoint keys as you need for your LUIS apps on Azure portal. These keys will be used for publishing your apps to the Web.

**To create an endpoint key on Azure portal:**

1.  Click **My Keys** on LUIS top navigation bar to access **My Keys** page.

2. On **My Keys** page, **Endpoint Keys** tab, click **Buy Key on Azure**. This will take you directly to Microsoft Azure portal. You can create one or more keys per account by subscribing to one or more subscription tiers. 
3. For further instructions, see [Creating a subscription key using Azure](AzureIbizaSubscription.md).

**To add the endpoint key to your LUIS account:**

1. On **My Keys** page, **Endpoint Keys** tab, click **Add a new key**.
 
    ![Add Azure key](./Images/MyKeys-AddKey.JPG)
2. Copy the key you created in Azure portal in the previous procedure and paste it in the **Key Value** text box. 
3. You can optionally type a name for the key in **Key Name**, for example "Tier1" , and then click **Save**. The key will be added to the keys list.

    ![My Keys List](./Images/MyKeys-Keylist.JPG)

In the list of added keys, you can edit a key name, or delete a key (if no longer needed). To do this, click the edit ![Edit Key Name button](./Images/Rename-Intent-btn.JPG) or delete button ![Delete Key button](./Images/trashbin-button.JPG) corresponding to that key in the list.

**To assign the endpoint key to your app:**

1. Access the **Publish** page by clicking **Publish App** on the left panel.

2. From the **Endpoint Key** list, select the key that you want to assign to the app. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >Whenever you assign a key to the app, an updated endpoint URL will be generated. Remember to use the updated endpoint URL in your code.


## Create and use external keys
External keys are the keys required for any external services that you want to use with your LUIS app to enhance the language understanding experience. One of these services, which is currently available, is [Bing Spell Check](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/bing-spell-check-api/documentation). It can be used with LUIS to detect and correct any spelling mistakes in end-user queries submitted to your application's endpoint.

**To create and add an external key to your LUIS account:**

1. On **My Keys** page, **External Keys**, click **Add a new key**. The following dialog box appears.

    ![Add a new external key](./Images/MyKeys-AddExternal.JPG)
2. From the **Key Type** list, select "BingSpellCheck".
3. Copy the key you created on Azure and paste it in **Key Value**, and then click **Save**. The key will be added to the keys list.


**To assign the external key to your app:**

1. Access the **Publish** page by clicking **Publish App** on the left panel.
2. Click **Add Key Association** ![Add Key Association button](./Images/MyKeys-AddKeyAssociation-btn.JPG).

3. Select Bing Spell Check as the key type from the **Key Type** list, and select from the **Key Value** list the external key that you want to assign to the app.

## Next steps

Use your key to publish your app in the **Publish app** page. For instructions on publishing, see [Publish app](PublishApp.md).
