# Azure Government Data + Analytics
This article outlines the data and analytics services, variations, and considerations for the Azure Government environment.

## HDInsight
HDInsight on Linux Standard is generally available in Azure Government. You can see a demo on how to build data-centric solutions on Azure Government using [HDInsight](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Azure/Cognitive-Services-HDInsight-and-Power-BI-on-Azure-Government).

### Variations
The following HDInsight features are not currently available in Azure Government.

* HDInsight is not available on Windows.
* Azure Data Lake Store is not currently available in Azure Government. Azure Blob Storage is the only available storage option currently.

The URLs for Log Analytics are different in Azure Government:

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HDInsight Cluster | \*.azurehdinsight.net | \*.azurehdinsight.us |

For secured virtual networks, you will want to allow Network Security Groups (NSGs) access to certain IP addresses and ports. For Azure Government, you should allow the follow IP addresses (all with an Allowed port of 443):

| Region | Allowed IP addresses | Allowed port |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| USGov Virginia | 13.72.49.126</br>13.72.55.55 | 443 |
| USGov Iowa | 13.72.184.124</br>13.72.190.110 | 443 |


For more information, see [HDInsight public documentation](../hdinsight/hadoop/apache-hadoop-introduction.md).
