# Azure Government Monitoring + Management
This article outlines the monitoring and management services variations and considerations for the Azure Government environment.

## Automation
Automation is generally available in Azure Government.
For more information, see [Automation public documentation](../automation/automation-intro.md).

## Backup
Backup is generally available in Azure Government.

For more information, see [Azure Government Backup](documentation-government-services-backup.md).

## Resource Policy

[Azure resource policies](../azure-policy/azure-policy-introduction.md) are not available in Azure Government.

## Site Recovery
Azure Site Recovery is generally available in Azure Government.

For more information, see [Site Recovery commercial documentation](../site-recovery/site-recovery-overview.md).

### Variations
The following Site Recovery features are not currently available in Azure Government:
* Email notification

| Site Recovery | Classic | Resource Manager |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VMWare/Physical  | GA | GA |
| Hyper-V | GA | GA |
| Site to Site | GA | GA |

The following URLs for Site Recovery are different in Azure Government:

| Azure Public | Azure Government | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | \*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.us | Access to the Site Recovery Service |
| \*.backup.windowsazure.com  | \*.backup.windowsazure.us | Access to Protection Service |
| \*.blob.core.windows.net | \*.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net | For storing the VM Snapshots |
| http://cdn.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi | http://cdn.mysql.com/archives/mysql-5.5/mysql-5.5.37-win32.msi | To download MySQL |

## Monitor
Azure Monitor is generally available in Azure Government.

For more information, see [Monitor commercial documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview).

### Variations
The following sections detail differences and workarounds for features of Azure Monitor in Azure Government:

#### Action Groups 
Action Groups do not support SMS at this time but will in a coming update.    

#### Activity Log Alerts
Activity Log Alerts are generally available in Azure Government with no differences from commercial Azure.

#### Autoscale
<aside class="warning">
Autoscale via the portal is not currently available. This feature is coming soon.  
</aside>

In the meantime, please use PowerShell/ARM/Rest calls to specify the settings. You will need to set the "Location" of the Autoscale to USGov Virginia or USGov Iowa. The resource targetted by Autoscale can exist in any region. An example of the setting is below:

```PowerShell
$rule1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "Requests" -MetricResourceId "/subscriptions/S1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/WebSite1" -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 10 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:05:00 -ScaleActionDirection Increase -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue "1" 
$rule2 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "Requests" -MetricResourceId "/subscriptions/S1/resourceGroups/RG1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/WebSite1" -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 10 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:10:00 -ScaleActionDirection Increase -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue "2"
$profile1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleProfile -DefaultCapacity 2 -MaximumCapacity 10 -MinimumCapacity 2 -Rules $rule1, $rule2 -Name "MyProfile"
$webhook_scale = New-AzureRmAutoscaleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?mytoken=mytokenvalue
$notification1= New-AzureRmAutoscaleNotification -CustomEmails myname@company.com -SendEmailToSubscriptionAdministrator -SendEmailToSubscriptionCoAdministrators -Webhooks $webhook_scale
Add-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -Location "USGov Virginia" -Name "MyScaleVMSSSetting" -ResourceGroup sdubeys-usgv -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverFarms/ServerFarm1 -AutoscaleProfiles $profile1 -Notifications $notification1
```

If you are interested in implementing autoscale on your resources, please use PowerShell/ARM/Rest calls to specify the settings. 

For more information on using PowerShell, please see [public documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-powershell-samples#create-and-manage-autoscale-settings).

#### Diagnostic Logs
Diagnostic Logs are generally available in Azure Government with no differences from commercial Azure.

#### Metrics
Metrics are supported in all regions, but only for services which are available in Azure Government; a few exceptions are below:

* Coming Soon: Azure IoT Hub

The same methods for viewing the metrics that are used in commercial Azure are used in Azure Government. 

#### Metric Alerts 
<aside class="warning">
Creating Metric Alerts for resources outside of USGov Virginia and USGov Iowa in the portal will fail. A fix for this issue is in progress. 
</aside>

In the meantime, please use PowerShell/ARM/Rest calls to specify the settings. You will need to set the "Location" of the metric alert to USGov Virginia or USGov Iowa. The resource targetted by the alert can exist in any region. An example of the setting is below:

```PowerShell
$actionEmail = New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail -CustomEmail myname@company.com 
$actionWebhook = New-AzureRmAlertRuleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?token=mytoken 
Add-AzureRmMetricAlertRule -Name vmcpu_gt_1 -Location "USGov Virginia" -ResourceGroup myrg1 -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/my_vm1 -MetricName "Percentage CPU" -Operator GreaterThan -Threshold 1 -WindowSize 00:05:00 -TimeAggregationOperator Average -Actions $actionEmail, $actionWebhook -Description "alert on CPU > 1%" 
```

For more information on using PowerShell, please see [public documentation](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-powershell-samples.md).

* To use [computer groups from System Center Configuration Manager 2016](../log-analytics/log-analytics-sccm.md), you need to be using [Technical Preview 1701](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/core/get-started/technical-preview) or later.

### Frequently asked questions
* Can I migrate data from Log Analytics in Microsoft Azure to Azure Government?
  * No. It is not possible to move data or your workspace from Microsoft Azure to Azure Government.
* Can I switch between Microsoft Azure and Azure Government workspaces from the Operations Management Suite Log Analytics portal?
  * No. The portals for Microsoft Azure and Azure Government are separate and do not share information.
