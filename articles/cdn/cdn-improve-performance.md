# Improve performance by compressing files in Azure CDN
Compression is a simple and effective method to improve file transfer speed and increase page load performance by reducing file size before it is sent from the server. It reduces bandwidth costs and provides a more responsive experience for your users.

There are two ways to enable compression:

* Enable compression on your origin server. In this case, the CDN passes through the compressed files and delivers them to clients that request them.
* Enable compression directly on the CDN edge servers. In this case, the CDN compresses the files and serves them to end users, even if they are not compressed by the origin server.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CDN configuration changes can take some time to propagate through the network.  For <b>Azure CDN from Akamai</b> profiles, propagation usually completes in under one minute.  For <b>Azure CDN from Verizon</b> profiles, your changes usually apply within 90 minutes.  If you're setting up compression for the first time for your CDN endpoint, consider waiting 1-2 hours before you troubleshoot to ensure the compression settings have propagated to the POPs.

## Enabling compression
> [!NOTE]
> The Standard and Premium CDN tiers provide the same compression functionality, but the user interface differs.  For more information about the differences between Standard and Premium CDN tiers, see [Azure CDN Overview](cdn-overview.md).
> 
> 

### Standard tier
> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to **Azure CDN Standard from Verizon** and **Azure CDN Standard from Akamai** profiles.
> 
> 

1. From the CDN profile page, click the CDN endpoint you wish to manage.
   
    ![CDN profile endpoints](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-endpoints.png)
   
    The CDN endpoint page opens.
2. Click the **Configure** button.
   
    ![CDN profile manage button](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-config-btn.png)
   
    The CDN Configuration page opens.
3. Turn on **Compression**.
   
    ![CDN compression options](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-compress-standard.png)
4. Use the default types, or modify the list by removing or adding file types.
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Although it is possible, it is not recommended to apply compression to compressed formats. For example, ZIP, MP3, MP4, or JPG.
   > 
 
5. After making your changes, click the **Save** button.

### Premium tier
> [!NOTE]
> This section applies to **Azure CDN Premium from Verizon** profiles.
> 
> 

1. From the CDN profile page, click the **Manage** button.
   
    ![CDN profile manage button](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-manage-btn.png)
   
    The CDN management portal opens.
2. Hover over the **HTTP Large** tab, then hover over the **Cache Settings** flyout.  Click on **Compression**.

    ![File compression selection](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-compress-select.png)
   
    Compression options are displayed.
   
    ![File compression options](./media/cdn-file-compression/cdn-compress-files.png)
3. Enable compression by clicking the **Compression Enabled** radio button.  Enter the MIME types you wish to compress as a comma-delimited list (no spaces) in the **File Types** textbox.
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Although it is possible, it is not recommended to apply compression to compressed formats. For example, ZIP, MP3, MP4, or JPG.
   > 
4. After making your changes, click the **Update** button.

## Compression rules
These tables describe Azure CDN compression behavior for every scenario.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For **Azure CDN from Verizon** profiles (Standard and Premium), only eligible files are compressed.  To be eligible for compression, a file must:
> 
> * Be larger than 128 bytes.
> * Be smaller than 1 MB.
> 
> These profiles support **gzip** (GNU zip), **deflate**, **bzip2**, or  **br** (Brotli) encoding. For Brotli encoding, the compression needs to be done at the origin. The client/browser must send the request for Brotli encoding and the compressed asset must have been compressed on the origin side first. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For **Azure CDN from Akamai** profiles, all files are eligible for compression. However, a file must be a MIME type that has been [configured for compression](#enabling-compression).
> 
>These profiles support only **gzip** encoding. When a profile endpoint requests **gzip** encoded files, they are always requested from the origin, regardless of the client request. 

### Compression disabled or file is ineligible for compression
| Client requested format (via Accept-Encoding header) | Cached file format | CDN response to the client | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compressed |Compressed |Compressed | |
| Compressed |Uncompressed |Uncompressed | |
| Compressed |Not cached |Compressed or Uncompressed |Depends on origin response |
| Uncompressed |Compressed |Uncompressed | |
| Uncompressed |Uncompressed |Uncompressed | |
| Uncompressed |Not cached |Uncompressed | |

### Compression enabled and file is eligible for compression
| Client requested format (via Accept-Encoding header) | Cached file format | CDN response to the client | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compressed |Compressed |Compressed |CDN transcodes between supported formats |
| Compressed |Uncompressed |Compressed |CDN performs compression |
| Compressed |Not cached |Compressed |CDN performs compression if origin returns uncompressed.  **Azure CDN from Verizon** passes the uncompressed file on the first request and then compresses and caches the file for subsequent requests.  Files with the `Cache-Control: no-cache` header are never compressed. |
| Uncompressed |Compressed |Uncompressed |CDN performs decompression |
| Uncompressed |Uncompressed |Uncompressed | |
| Uncompressed |Not cached |Uncompressed | |

## Media Services CDN Compression
For Media Services CDN enabled streaming endpoints, compression is enabled by default for the following content types: 
- application/vnd.ms-sstr+xml 
- application/dash+xml
- application/vnd.apple.mpegurl
- application/f4m+xml. 

You cannot enable or disable compression for the mentioned types by using the Azure portal.
