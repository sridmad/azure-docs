# Monitor data factories using Azure Monitor  
Cloud applications are complex with many moving parts. Monitoring provides data to ensure that your application stays up and running in a healthy state. It also helps you to stave off potential problems or troubleshoot past ones. In addition, you can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your application. This knowledge can help you to improve application performance or maintainability, or automate actions that would otherwise require manual intervention.

Azure Monitor provides base level infrastructure metrics and logs for most services in Microsoft Azure. For details, see [monitoring overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor). Azure Diagnostic logs are logs emitted by a resource that provide rich, frequent data about the operation of that resource. Data Factory outputs diagnostic logs in Azure Monitor. 

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to version 2 of Data Factory, which is currently in preview. If you are using version 1 of the Data Factory service, which is generally available (GA), see [Monitor and manage pipelines in Data Factory version1](v1/data-factory-monitor-manage-pipelines.md).

## Diagnostic logs

* Save them to a **Storage Account** for auditing or manual inspection. You can specify the retention time (in days) using the diagnostic settings.
* Stream them to **Event Hubs** for ingestion by a third-party service or custom analytics solution such as PowerBI.
* Analyze them with **Operations Management Suite (OMS) Log Analytics**

You can use a storage account or event hub namespace that is not in the same subscription as the resource that is emitting logs. The user who configures the setting must have the appropriate role-based access control (RBAC) access to both subscriptions.

## Set up diagnostic logs

### Diagnostic Settings
Diagnostic Logs for non-compute resources are configured using diagnostic settings. Diagnostic settings for a resource control:

* Where diagnostic logs are sent (Storage Account, Event Hubs, and/or OMS Log Analytics).
* Which log categories are sent.
* How long each log category should be retained in a storage account
* A retention of zero days means logs are kept forever. Otherwise, the value can be any number of days between 1 and 2147483647.
* If retention policies are set but storing logs in a storage account is disabled (for example, only Event Hubs or OMS options are selected), the retention policies have no effect.
* Retention policies are applied per-day, so at the end of a day (UTC), logs from the day that is now beyond the retention policy are deleted. For example, if you had a retention policy of one day, at the beginning of the day today the logs from the day before yesterday would be deleted.

### Enable diagnostic logs via REST APIs

Create or update a diagnostics setting in Azure Monitor REST API

**Request**
```
PUT
https://management.azure.com/{resource-id}/providers/microsoft.insights/diagnosticSettings/service?api-version={api-version}
```

**Headers**
* Replace `{api-version}` with `2016-09-01`.
* Replace `{resource-id}` with the resource ID of the resource for which you would like to edit diagnostic settings. For more information [Using Resource groups to manage your Azure resources](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md).
* Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
* Set the authorization header to a JSON web token that you obtain from Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Authenticating requests](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).

### Metrics

Azure Monitor enables you to consume telemetry to gain visibility into the performance and health of your workloads on Azure. The most important type of Azure telemetry data is the metrics (also called performance counters) emitted by most Azure resources. Azure Monitor provides several ways to configure and consume these metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting.

ADFV2 emits the following metrics

| **Metric**           | **Metric Display Name**         | **Unit** | **Aggregation Type** | **Description**                                       |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| PipelineSucceededRun | Succeeded pipeline runs metrics | Count    | Total                | Total pipelines runs succeeded within a minute window |
| PipelineFailedRuns   | Failed pipeline runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | Total pipelines runs failed within a minute window    |
| ActiviySucceededRuns | Succeeded activity runs metrics | Count    | Total                | Total activity runs succeeded within a minute window  |
| ActivityFailedRuns   | Failed activity runs metrics    | Count    | Total                | Total activity runs failed within a minute window     |
| TriggerSucceededRuns | Succeeded trigger runs metrics  | Count    | Total                | Total trigger runs succeeded within a minute window   |
| TriggerFailedRuns    | Failed trigger runs metrics     | Count    | Total                | Total trigger runs failed within a minute window      |

To access the metrics, follow the instructions in the article - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics
