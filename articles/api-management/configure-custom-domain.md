# Configure a custom domain name 

When you create an API Management (APIM) instance, Azure assigns it to a subdomain of azure-api.net (for example, `apim-service-name.azure-api.net`). However, you can expose your APIM endpoints using your own domain name, such as **contoso.com**. This tutorial shows you how to map an existing custom DNS name to endpoints exposed by an Azure API Management instance.


## Prerequisites

To perform the steps described in this article, you must have:

+ An active Azure subscription.

    [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

+ An APIM instance. For more information, see [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
+ A custom domain name that is owned by you. The custom domain name you want to use, must be procured separately and hosted on a DNS server. This topic does not give instructions on how to host a custom domain name.
+ You must have a valid certificate with a public and private key (.PFX). Subject or subject alternative name (SAN) has to match the domain name (this enables APIM to securely expose URLs over SSL).

## Use the Azure portal to set a custom domain name

1. Navigate to your APIM instance in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Select **Custom domains and SSL**.
    
    There is a number of endpoints to which you can assign a custom domain name. Currently, the following endpoints are available: 
    + **Proxy** (default is: `<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net`), 
    + **Portal** (default is: `<apim-service-name>.portal.azure-api.net`),     
    + **Management** (default is: `<apim-service-name>.management.azure-api.net`), 
    + **SCM** (default is: `<apim-service-name>.scm.azure-api.net`).

    >[!NOTE]
    > You can update all of the endpoints or some of them. Commonly, customers update **Proxy** (this URL is used to call the API exposed through API Management) and **Portal** (the developer portal URL). **Management** and **SCM** endpoints are used internally by APIM customers and thus are less frequently assigned a custom domain name.
3. Select the endpoint that you want to update. 
4. In the window on the right, click **Custom**.

    + In the **Custom domain name**, specify the name you want to use. For example, `api.contoso.com`. <br/>Wildcard domain names (for example, *.domain.com) are also supported.
    + In the **Certificate**, specify a valid .PFX file that you want to upload. 
    + If the certificate has a password, enter it in the **Password** field.
1. Click Apply.

    >[!NOTE]
    >The process of assigning the certificate may take 15 minutes or so.
