# Create and manage Azure Database for MySQL firewall rules by using the Azure portal
Server-level firewall rules enable administrators to access an Azure Database for MySQL Server from a specified IP address or a range of IP addresses. 

## Create a server-level firewall rule in the Azure portal

1. On the MySQL server blade, under Settings heading, click **Connection Security** to open the Connection Security blade for the Azure Database for MySQL.

2. Click **Add My IP** on the toolbar to create a rule with the IP address of your computer, as perceived by the Azure system.

3. Verify your IP address before saving the configuration. In some situations, the IP address observed by Azure portal differs from the IP address used when accessing the internet and Azure servers. Therefore, you may need to change the Start IP and End IP to make the rule function as expected.

   Use a search engine or other online tool to check your own IP address (for example, search "what is my IP address").

4. Add additional address ranges. In the rules for the Azure Database for MySQL firewall, you can specify a single IP address or a range of addresses. If you want to limit the rule to a single IP address, type the same address in the Start IP and End IP fields. Opening the firewall enables administrators and users to access any database on the MySQL server to which they have valid credentials.

5. Click **Save** on the toolbar to save this server-level firewall rule. Wait for the confirmation that the update to the firewall rules is  successful.

## Manage existing server-level firewall rules by using the Azure portal
Repeat the steps to manage the firewall rules.
* To add the current computer, click **+ Add My IP**.
* To add additional IP addresses, type in the **RULE NAME**, **START IP**, and **END IP**.
* To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule, and then modify.
* To delete an existing rule, click the ellipsis [â€¦], and then click **Delete**.
* Click **Save** to save the changes.
