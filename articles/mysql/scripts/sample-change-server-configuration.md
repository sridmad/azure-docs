# List and update configurations of an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script lists all available configuration parameters as well as their allowable values for Azure Database for MySQL server, and sets the *innodb_lock_wait_timeout* to a value that is other than the default one.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script
In this sample script, change the highlighted lines to customize the admin username and password.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/change-server-configurations/change-server-configurations.sh?highlight=15-16 "List and update configurations of Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/change-server-configurations/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]
