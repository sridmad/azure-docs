# Monitor and scale an Azure Database for MySQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script scales a single Azure Database for MySQL server to a different performance level after querying the metrics.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this article requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script
In this sample script, change the highlighted lines to customize the admin username and password. Replace the subscription ID used in the az monitor commands with your own subscription id.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/scale-mysql-server/scale-mysql-server.sh?highlight=15-16 "Create and scale Azure Database for MySQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
After the script sample has been run, you can remove the resource group and all resources associated with it by running the following command:
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/mysql/scale-mysql-server/delete-mysql.sh  "Delete the resource group.")]

## Script explanation
This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az mysql server create](/cli/azure/mysql/server#create) | Creates a MySQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#list) | List the metric value for the resources. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
