# Set up Cloud App Discovery in Azure AD

Cloud App Discovery in Azure AD is now based on integration with data available from Microsoft Cloud App Security. To provide ongoing information on cloud use and shadow IT, Cloud App Discovery compares your traffic logs to the Cloud App Security catalog of over 15,000 cloud apps. This article describes the setup process and contains links to the detailed information for each step. It also describes firewall and proxy information and log file support.

## Prerequisites

* Your organization must have an Azure AD Premium P1 license to use the product. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/).
* To set up Cloud App Discovery, you must be a Global Administrator or a Security Reader in Azure Active Directory.

## Setup steps

1. [Set up snapshot reports](cloudappdiscovery-set-up-snapshots.md) to check your log format make sure your logs provide usable information to Cloud App Discovery. They can also provide ad-hoc visibility into traffic logs you manually upload from your firewalls and proxy servers.

2. [Set up continuous reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker) to analyze all logs that are forwarded from your network using the Cloud App Security log collector. You can use them to identify new apps and usage trends.

3. If your logs are not currently supported, [set up a custom log parser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/custom-log-parser) so that Cloud App Discovery can analyze them.
  
## Log processing flow

It can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to generate reports depending on the amount of data. Here's what is analyzed:

* **Upload**
  Web traffic logs from your network are uploaded to the portal.
* **Parse**
  Cloud App Security parses and extracts traffic data from the traffic logs with a dedicated parser for each data source.
* **Analyze**
  Traffic data is analyzed against the Cloud App Security catalog to identify more than 15,000 cloud apps. Active users and IP addresses are also identified as part of the analysis.
* **Generate report**
  Cloud App Security generates a report of the data extracted from log files and makes it available to Cloud App Discovery.

> [!NOTE]
> * Continuous report data is analyzed twice a day.
> * The log collector compresses data before it is uploaded. The outbound traffic on the log collector is around 10% of the size of the received traffic logs.

## Using traffic logs for Cloud App Discovery

Cloud App Discovery uses the data in your traffic logs. The more detail you can add in your log, the better visibility you get. Cloud App Discovery requires web-traffic data with the following attributes:

* Date of the transaction
* Source IP address
* Source user **recommended**
* Destination IP address
* Destination URL **recommended** (URLs provide more accuracy for cloud app detection than IP addresses)
* Total amount of data
* Amount of uploaded or downloaded data, for insights about patterns of cloud app usage
* Action taken (allowed/blocked)

Cloud App Discovery can't show or analyze attributes that are not included in your logs. For example, **Cisco ASA Firewall** standard log format does not contain the **Amount of uploaded bytes per transaction**, **Username**, or **Target URL** but only the destination IP address. Thus, you might have less visibility into the cloud apps from this data source. For Cisco ASA firewalls, set the information level to 6.1.

In order to successfully generate a Cloud App Discovery report, your traffic logs must meet the following conditions:

1.  Data source is [a supported firewall or proxy server](#supported-firewalls-and-proxies).
2.  Log format matches the expected standard format. This is checked at upload time. To optimize uour log format, see [Create snapshot Cloud App Discovery reports](cloudappdiscovery-set-up-snapshots.md).
3.  Events are not more than 90 days old.
4.  The log file is valid and includes outbound traffic information.

## Supported firewalls and proxy servers

* Barracuda - Web App Firewall (W3C)
* Blue Coat Proxy SG - Access log (W3C)
* Check Point
* Cisco ASA Firewall (For Cisco ASA firewalls, set the information level to 6)
* Cisco IronPort WSA
* Cisco ScanSafe
* Cisco Meraki – URLs log
* Clavister NGFW (Syslog)
* Dell Sonicwall
* Fortinet Fortigate
* Juniper SRX
* Juniper SSG
* McAfee Secure Web Gateway
* Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway (W3C)
* Palo Alto series Firewall
* Sophos SG
* Sophos Cyberoam
* Squid (Common)
* Squid (Native)
* Websense - Web Security Solutions - Investigative detail report (CSV)
* Websense - Web Security Solutions - Internet activity log (CEF)
* Zscaler

> [!NOTE]
> Cloud App Discovery supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

If your log is not supported, select **Other** as the **Data source** and specify the device and log you are trying to upload. Your log is reviewed by the Cloud App Security cloud analyst team. When support for your log type is added we notify you, but instead, you can define a custom parser that matches your log format. For more information, see [Use a custom log parser](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/custom-log-parser).
