# Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On: Frequently asked questions

In this article, we address frequently asked questions about Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-On (Seamless SSO). Keep checking back for new content.

## What sign-in methods do Seamless SSO work with?

Seamless SSO can be combined with either the [Password Hash Synchronization](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md) or [Pass-through Authentication](active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication.md) sign-in methods. However this feature cannot be used with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).

## Is Seamless SSO a free feature?

Seamless SSO is a free feature and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it. It remains free when the feature reaches general availability.

## What applications take advantage of `domain_hint` or `login_hint` parameter capability of Seamless SSO?

We are in the process of compiling the list of applications that send these parameters and the ones that don't. If you have applications that are interested in, let us know in the comments section.

## Does Seamless SSO support `Alternate ID` as the username, instead of `userPrincipalName`?

Yes. Seamless SSO supports `Alternate ID` as the username when configured in Azure AD Connect as shown [here](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md). Not all Office 365 applications support `Alternate ID`. Refer to the specific application's documentation for the support statement.

## I want to register non-Windows 10 devices with Azure AD, without using AD FS. Can I use Seamless SSO instead?

Yes, this scenario needs version 2.1 or later of the [workplace-join client](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53554).

## How can I roll over the Kerberos decryption key of the `AZUREADSSOACC` computer account?

It is important to frequently roll over the Kerberos decryption key of the `AZUREADSSOACC` computer account (which represents Azure AD) created in your on-premises AD forest.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>We highly recommend that you roll over the Kerberos decryption key at least every 30 days.

Follow these steps on the on-premises server where you are running Azure AD Connect:

### Step 1. Get list of AD forests where Seamless SSO has been enabled

1. First, download, and install the [Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286152).
2. Then download and install the [64-bit Azure Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236297).
3. Navigate to the `%programfiles%\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect` folder.
4. Import the Seamless SSO PowerShell module using this command: `Import-Module .\AzureADSSO.psd1`.
5. Run PowerShell as an Administrator. In PowerShell, call `New-AzureADSSOAuthenticationContext`. This command should give you a popup to enter your tenant's Global Administrator credentials.
6. Call `Get-AzureADSSOStatus`. This command provides you the list of AD forests (look at the "Domains" list) on which this feature has been enabled.

### Step 2. Update the Kerberos decryption key on each AD forest that it was set it up on

1. Call `$creds = Get-Credential`. When prompted, enter the Domain Administrator credentials for the intended AD forest.
2. Call `Update-AzureADSSOForest -OnPremCredentials $creds`. This command updates the Kerberos decryption key for the `AZUREADSSOACC` computer account in this specific AD forest and updates it in Azure AD.
3. Repeat the preceding steps for each AD forest that youâ€™ve set up the feature on.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Ensure that you _don't_ run the `Update-AzureADSSOForest` command more than once. Otherwise, the feature stops working until the time your users' Kerberos tickets expire and are reissued by your on-premises Active Directory.

## How can I disable Seamless SSO?

Seamless SSO can be disabled using Azure AD Connect.

Run Azure AD Connect, choose "Change user sign-in page" and click "Next". Then uncheck the "Enable single sign on" option. Continue through the wizard. After completion of the wizard, Seamless SSO is disabled on your tenant.

However, you see a message on screen that reads as follows:

"Single sign-on is now disabled, but there are additional manual steps to perform in order to complete clean-up. Learn more"

To complete the process, follow these manual steps on the on-premises server where you are running Azure AD Connect:

### Step 1. Get list of AD forests where Seamless SSO has been enabled

1. First, download, and install the [Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286152).
2. Then download and install the [64-bit Azure Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=236297).
3. Navigate to the `%programfiles%\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect` folder.
4. Import the Seamless SSO PowerShell module using this command: `Import-Module .\AzureADSSO.psd1`.
5. Run PowerShell as an Administrator. In PowerShell, call `New-AzureADSSOAuthenticationContext`. This command should give you a popup to enter your tenant's Global Administrator credentials.
6. Call `Get-AzureADSSOStatus`. This command provides you the list of AD forests (look at the "Domains" list) on which this feature has been enabled.

### Step 2. Manually delete the `AZUREADSSOACCT` computer account from each AD forest that you see listed.
