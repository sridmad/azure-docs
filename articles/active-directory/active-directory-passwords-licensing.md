# Licensing requirements for Azure AD self-service password reset

In order for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) password reset to function, you *must have at least one license assigned in your organization*. We don't enforce per-user licensing on the password reset experience. To maintain compliance with your Microsoft licensing agreement, you need to assign licenses to any users that use premium features.

* **Cloud-only users**: Office 365 any paid SKU, or Azure AD Basic
* **Cloud** or **on-premises users**: Azure AD Premium P1 or P2, Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), or Secure Productive Enterprise (SPE)

## Licenses required for password writeback

To use password writeback, you must have one of the following licenses assigned on your tenant:

* Azure AD Premium P1
* Azure AD Premium P2
* Enterprise Mobility + Security E3
* Enterprise Mobility + Security E5
* Microsoft 365 (Plan E3)
* Microsoft 365 (Plan E5)

> [!WARNING]
> Standalone Office 365 licensing plans *don't support password writeback* and require that you have one of the preceding plans for this functionality to work.

Additional licensing information, including costs, can be found on the following pages:

* [Azure Active Directory pricing site](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/)
* [Azure Active Directory features and capabilities](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory-features)
* [Enterprise Mobility + Security](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/enterprise-mobility-security)
* [Microsoft 365 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise)

## Enable group or user-based licensing

Azure AD now supports group-based licensing. Administrators can assign licenses in bulk to a group of users, rather than assigning them one at a time. For more information, see [Assign, verify, and resolve problems with licenses](active-directory-licensing-group-assignment-azure-portal.md#step-1-assign-the-required-licenses).

Some Microsoft services are not available in all locations. Before a license can be assigned to a user, the administrator must specify the **Usage location** property on the user. Assignment of licenses can be done under the **User** > **Profile** > **Settings** section in the Azure portal. *When you use group license assignment, any users without a usage location specified inherit the location of the directory.*
