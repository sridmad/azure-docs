# Register for self-service password reset

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Are you here because you're having problems signing in?** If so, [here's how you can change and reset your own password](active-directory-passwords-update-your-own-password.md).

As an end user, you can reset your password or unlock your account without having to speak to a person using self-service password reset (SSPR). Before you can use this functionality, you have to register authentication methods or confirm the predefined authentication methods your administrator has populated.

## Register or confirm authentication data with SSPR

1. Open the web browser on your device and go to the [password reset registration page](http://aka.ms/ssprsetup)
2. Enter your username and password provided by your administrator
3. Depending on how your IT staff have configured things, one or more of the following options are available for you to configure and verify. Your administrator may populate some of this for you if they have your permission to use the information.
    * Office phone is only able to be set by your administrator
    * Authentication Phone should be set to another phone number you would have access to like a cell phone that can receive a text or call.
    * Authentication Email should be set to an alternate email address that you can access without the password you need to reset.
    * Security Questions gives you a list of questions your administrator has approved for you to answer. You may not use the same question or answer more than once.
4. Provide and verify the information required by your administrator. If more than one option is available, we suggest that you register multiple methods to provide flexibility when another method is unavailable (Example: Traveling and unable to access your office phone)

    ![Register authentication methods and click finish][Register]

5. When done with step 4 choose **finish** and you will now be able to use self-service password reset when you need to in the future.

If you enter data in the Authentication Phone or Authentication Email, it is not visible in the global directory. The only people who can see this data are you and your administrators. Only you can see the answers to your Security Questions.

Administrators may require you to confirm your authentication methods after a period of time to make sure you still have the appropriate methods registered.
