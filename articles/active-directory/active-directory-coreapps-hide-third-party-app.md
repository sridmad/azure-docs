# Hide a third-party application from user's experience in Azure Active Directory

If you have a third-party application (an app published by others than Microsoft) that you do not want to show up on the users’ access panels or Office 365 launchers, there is an option to hide this app tile. By hiding the app users still have permissions to the app but will not see them appear on their app launchers. You must have the appropriate permissions to manage the enterprise app, and you must be global admin for the directory.

## Hiding a third-party app from a user's experience
Use the following steps to hide a third party app from a user's access panel and Office 365 app launchers

### How do I hide a third-party app from user’s access panel and O365 app launchers?

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2.	Select **More services**, enter **Azure Active Directory** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.
3.	On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** screen (that is, the Azure AD screen for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise applications**.
