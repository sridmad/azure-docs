# Azure AD access reviews (preview)

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) access reviews enable organizations to efficiently manage group memberships and access to enterprise applications. 

## What can you do with access reviews?
   
- You can recertify guest user access by using access reviews of their access to applications and memberships of groups. Reviewers can use the insights that are provided to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.
      
- You can recertify employee access to applications and group memberships with access reviews.
   
- You can collect access review controls into programs that are relevant for your organization to track reviews for compliance or risk-sensitive applications.
