# Azure Active Directory audit API reference
This topic is part of a collection of topics about the Azure Active Directory reporting API.  
Azure AD reporting provides you with an API that enables you to access audit data using code or related tools.
The scope of this topic is to provide you with reference information about the **audit API**.

See:

* [Audit logs](active-directory-reporting-azure-portal.md#activity-reports)  for more conceptual information

* [Getting started with the Azure Active Directory Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md) for more information about the reporting API.


For:

- Frequently asked questions, read our [FAQ](active-directory-reporting-faq.md) 

- Issues, please [file a support ticket](active-directory-troubleshooting-support-howto.md) 


## Who can access the data?
* Users in the Security Admin or Security Reader role
* Global Admins
* Any app that has authorization to access the API (app authorization can be setup only based on Global Admin’s permission)

## Prerequisites
In order to access this report through the Reporting API, you must have:

* An [Azure Active Directory Free or better edition](active-directory-editions.md)
* Completed the [prerequisites to access the Azure AD reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-prerequisites.md). 

## Accessing the API
You can either access this API through the [Graph Explorer](https://graphexplorer2.cloudapp.net) or programmatically using, for example, PowerShell. In order for PowerShell to correctly interpret the OData filter syntax used in AAD Graph REST calls, you must use the backtick (aka: grave accent) character to “escape” the $ character. The backtick character serves as [PowerShell’s escape character](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847755.aspx), allowing PowerShell to do a literal interpretation of the $ character, and avoid confusing it as a PowerShell variable name (ie: $filter).

The focus of this topic is on the Graph Explorer. For a PowerShell example, see this [PowerShell script](active-directory-reporting-api-audit-samples.md#powershell-script).

## API Endpoint
You can access this API using the following URI:  

    https://graph.windows.net/contoso.com/activities/audit?api-version=beta

There is no limit on the number of records returned by the Azure AD audit API (using OData pagination).
For retention limits on reporting data, check out [Reporting Retention Policies](active-directory-reporting-retention.md).

This call returns the data in batches. Each batch has a maximum of 1000 records.  
To get the next batch of records, use the Next link. Get the skiptoken information from the first set of returned records. The skip token will be at the end of the result set.  

    https://graph.windows.net/contoso.com/activities/audit?api-version=beta&%24skiptoken=-1339686058




## Supported filters
You can narrow down the number of records that are returned by an API call in form of a filter.  
For sign-in API related data, the following filters are supported:

* **$top=\<number of records to be returned\>** - to limit the number of returned records. This is an expensive operation. You should not use this filter if you want to return thousands of objects.     
* **$filter=\<your filter statement\>** - to specify, on the basis of supported filter fields, the type of records you care about

## Supported filter fields and operators
To specify the type of records you care about, you can build a filter statement that can contain either one or a combination of the following filter fields:

* [activityDate](#activitydate)  - defines a date or date range
* [category](#category) - defines the category you want to filter on.
* [activityStatus](#activitystatus) - defines the status of an activity
* [activityType](#activitytype)  - defines the type of an activity
* [activity](#activity) - defines the activity as string  
* [actor/name](#actorname) -   defines the actor in form of the actor's name
* [actor/objectid](#actorobjectid) - defines the actor in form of the actor's ID   
* [actor/upn](#actorupn)  - defines the actor in form of the actor's user principle name (UPN) 
* [target/name](#targetname)  - defines the target in form of the actor's name
* [target/objectid](#targetobjectid) - defines the target in form of the target's ID  
* [target/upn](#targetupn) - defines the actor in form of the actor's user principle name (UPN)
