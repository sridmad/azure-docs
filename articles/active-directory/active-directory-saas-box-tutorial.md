# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Box

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Box with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Box with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Box.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Box (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Box, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Box single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Box from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Box from the gallery
To configure the integration of Box into Azure AD, you need to add Box from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Box from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications section][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Box**, select **Box** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Box based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Box is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Box needs to be established.

In Box, assign the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** to establish the link relationship.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Box, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configure-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Create a Box test user](#create-a-box-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Box that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Test single sign-on](#test-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configure Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Box application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Box, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Box** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Single sign-on dialog box](./media/active-directory-saas-box-tutorial/tutorial_box_samlbase.png)

3. On the **Box Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Box Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/active-directory-saas-box-tutorial/url3.png)

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<subdomain>.box.com`

	b. Check **Show advanced URL settings**.

    c. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL as: `https://sso.services.box.net/sp/ACS.saml2`
	 
	> [!NOTE] 
	> This value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-on URL. Contact [Box Client support team](https://community.box.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/submit_sso_questionaire) to get this value. 

4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Metadata XML** and then save the metadata file on your computer.

	![The Certificate download link](./media/active-directory-saas-box-tutorial/tutorial_box_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On Save button](./media/active-directory-saas-box-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)
	
6. To get SSO configured for your application, Contact [Box Client support team](https://community.box.com/t5/custom/page/page-id/submit_sso_questionaire) and provide them with the downloadedÂ XML file.

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)

### Create an Azure AD test user

### Create a Box test user

In this section, a user called Britta Simon is created in Box. Box supports just-in-time provisioning, which is enabled by default.
There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Box, a new one is created when you attempt to access Box.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable Britta Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Box.

![Assign the user role][200] 

**To assign Britta Simon to Box, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, open the applications view, and then navigate to the directory view and go to **Enterprise applications** then click **All applications**.

	![Assign User][201] 

2. In the applications list, select **Box**.
