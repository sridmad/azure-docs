# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with WORKS MOBILE

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate WORKS MOBILE with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating WORKS MOBILE with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to WORKS MOBILE
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to WORKS MOBILE (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with WORKS MOBILE, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A WORKS MOBILE single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description
In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding WORKS MOBILE from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding WORKS MOBILE from the gallery
To configure the integration of WORKS MOBILE into Azure AD, you need to add WORKS MOBILE from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add WORKS MOBILE from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![Active Directory][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![Applications][2]
	
3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![Applications][3]

4. In the search box, type **WORKS MOBILE**.

5. In the results panel, select **WORKS MOBILE**, and then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_worksmobile_addfromgallery.png)

##  Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with WORKS MOBILE based on a test user called "Britta Simon."

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in WORKS MOBILE is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in WORKS MOBILE needs to be established.

This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in WORKS MOBILE.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with WORKS MOBILE, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a WORKS MOBILE test user](#creating-a-works-mobile-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in WORKS MOBILE that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your WORKS MOBILE application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with WORKS MOBILE, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **WORKS MOBILE** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure Single Sign-On][4]

2. On the **Single sign-on** dialog, select **Mode** as	**SAML-based Sign-on** to enable single sign-on.
 
	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_worksmobile_samlbase.png)

3. On the **WORKS MOBILE Domain and URLs** section, perform the following steps:

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_worksmobile_url.png)

    a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://auth.worksmobile.com/d/login/{domain}/?userId={ID@domain}`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type the value as `worksmobile.com`

	> [!NOTE] 
	> This value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [WORKS MOBILE Client support team](mailto:dl_ssoinfo@worksmobile.com) to get this value. 
 
4. On the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Certificate(Raw)** and then save the certificate file on your computer.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_worksmobile_certificate.png) 

5. Click **Save** button.

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_general_400.png)

6. On the **WORKS MOBILE Configuration** section, click **Configure WORKS MOBILE** to open **Configure sign-on** window. Copy the **Sign-Out URL, SAML Entity ID, and SAML Single Sign-On Service URL** from the **Quick Reference section.**

	![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-worksmobile-tutorial/tutorial_worksmobile_configure.png) 

7. To get SSO configured for your application, contact [WORKS MOBILE support team](mailto:dl_ssoinfo@worksmobile.com) and provide them with the following information: 

	• The downloaded **Certificate file**

	• The **SAML Single Sign-On Service URL**

	• The **SAML Entity ID**

	• The **Sign-Out URL**

> [!TIP]
> You can now read a concise version of these instructions inside the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), while you are setting up the app!  After adding this app from the **Active Directory > Enterprise Applications** section, simply click the **Single Sign-On** tab and access the embedded documentation through the **Configuration** section at the bottom. You can read more about the embedded documentation feature here: [Azure AD embedded documentation]( https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845985)
