# Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory

Using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can designate separate administrators to serve different functions. Administrators have access to various features in the Azure portal or Azure classic portal and, depending on their role, can create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains, among other things. A user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud services that your organization has subscribed to, regardless of whether you assign the role in the Office 365 portal, or in the Azure classic portal, or by using the Azure AD module for Windows PowerShell.

The following administrator roles are available:

* **Billing Administrator**: Makes purchases, manages subscriptions, manages support tickets, and monitors service health.

* **Compliance Administrator**:Users with this role have management permissions within in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center and Exchange Admin Center.

## Details about the global administrator role
The global administrator has access to all administrative features. By default, the person who signs up for an Azure subscription is assigned the global administrator role for the directory. Only global administrators can assign other administrator roles.

### To add a colleague as a global administrator

1. Sign in to the [Azure Active Directory Admin Center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the tenant directory.
