# Sign-in activity report error codes in the Azure Active Directory portal

With the information provided by the user sign-ins report, you find answers to questions such as:

- Who has signed-in using Azure Active Directory?
- Which apps were signed into?
- Which sign-ins were failures and if so why?

This topic lists the error codes and the related descriptions. 

## How can I display failed sign-ins? 

Your first entry point to all sign-in activities data is **[Sign-ins](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/SignIns)** in the **Activity** section of **Azure Active**.


![Sign-in activity](./media/active-directory-reporting-activity-sign-ins-errors/61.png "Sign-in activity")


In your sign-ins report, you can display all failed sign-ins by selecting **Failure** as **Sign-in status**.


![Sign-in activity](./media/active-directory-reporting-activity-sign-ins-errors/06.png "Sign-in activity")

Clicking an item in the displayed list, opens the **Activity Details: Sign-ins** blade. 
This view provides you with all the details that Azure Active Directory tracks about sign-ins, including the **sign-in error code** and a **failure reason**.

As an alternative to using the Azure portal to access the sign-ins data, you can also use the [reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started-azure-portal.md).


The following section provides you with a complete overview of all possible errors and the related descriptions.
