# Features & tools for Bash in Azure Cloud Shell

[!include [features-introblock](../../includes/cloud-shell-features-introblock.md)]

> [!TIP]
> Features & tools in [PowerShell](features-powershell.md) is also available.

Bash in Cloud Shell runs on `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`.

## Features

### Secure automatic authentication

Bash in Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates account access for the Azure CLI 2.0.

### SSH into Azure Linux virtual machines

Creating a Linux VM from Azure CLI 2.0 can create a default SSH key and place it in your `$Home` directory. Placing SSH keys in `$Home`  enables direct SSH connections to Azure Linux VMs directly from Cloud Shell. Keys are held in acc_<user>.img in your file share, use best practices when using or sharing access to your file share or keys.

### $Home persistence across sessions

To persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell walks you through attaching an Azure file share on first launch.
Once completed, Cloud Shell will automatically attach your storage (mounted as `$Home\clouddrive`) for all future sessions.
Additionally, in Bash in Cloud Shell your `$Home` directory is persisted as an .img in your Azure File share.
Files outside of `$Home` and machine state are not persisted across sessions.
