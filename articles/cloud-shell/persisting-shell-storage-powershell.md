## How PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell (Preview) works
PowerShell in Cloud Shell (Preview) persists files through the following method: 
* Mounting your specified file share as `clouddrive` in your `$Home` directory for direct file-share interaction.

## List Cloud Drive file shares
The `Get-CloudDrive` command retrieves the file share information currently mounted by the Cloud Drive in the Cloud Shell. <br>

## Unmount Cloud Drive
You can unmount a file share that's mounted to Cloud Shell at any time. If the file share has been removed, you will be prompted to create and mount a new file share at the next session.

The `Dismount-CloudDrive` command unmounts a file share from the current storage account. Dismounting the Cloud Drive terminates the current session. The user will be prompted to create and mount a new file share during the next session.
