# Overview of Monitoring in Microsoft Azure
This article provides an overview of the tools and services involved in holistically monitoring Microsoft Azure. It applies to:
- Using Azure services to monitor Azure infrastructure and applications
- Using Azure services to monitor hybrid and non-Azure infrastructure and applications
- Using non-Azure services to monitor Azure infrastructure and applications

This article discusses the various products and services available and how they work together. It can assist you to determine which tools are most appropriate for you in what cases.  

## Why use Azure's monitoring services?

Performance issues in your cloud app can impact your business. With multiple interconnected components and frequent releases, degradations can happen at any time. And if you’re developing an app, your users usually discover issues that you didn’t find in testing. You should know about these issues immediately, and have tools for diagnosing and fixing the problems. Furthermore, problems in your application can result from the underlying infrastructure on which those applications run, so having a holistic view of your application and infrastructure is key to monitoring your Azure environment. Microsoft Azure has a range of tools for identifying and resolving such problems.

## How do I monitor my Azure environment?

There are a range of tools for monitoring your Azure environment, from the application code running on Azure to the services and infrastructure hosting your application. These tools work together to offer comprehensive cloud monitoring and include:

-	**Azure Monitor** - the Azure service that operates as a consolidated pipeline for all monitoring data from Azure services. It gives you access to performance metrics and events that describe the operation of the Azure infrastructure and any Azure services you are using. Azure Monitor is a monitoring data pipeline for your Azure environment, and offers that data directly into Log Analytics as well as 3rd party tools where you can gain insight into that data and combine it with data from on premises or other cloud resources.

-	**Application Insights** - the Azure service that offers application performance monitoring and user analytics. It monitors the code you've written and applications you've deployed on Azure, on-premises, or other clouds. By instrumenting your application with the Application Insights SDK you can get access to a range of data including response times of dependencies, exception traces, debugging snapshots, and execution profiles. It provides powerful tools for analyzing this application telemetry while developing and operating your application. It deeply integrates with Visual Studio to enable you to get right to the problem line(s) of code so you can fix it, and offers usage analytics to analyze customer usage of your applications for product managers as well.

-	**Log Analytics** - formerly known as OMS Log Analytics, is an Azure service that ingests log and metric data from Azure services (via Azure Monitor), Azure VMs, and on-premises or other cloud infrastructure and offers flexible log search and out-of-the box analytics on top of this data. It provides rich tools to analyze data across sources, allows complex queries across all logs, and can proactively alert on specified conditions.  You can even collect custom data into its central repository so you can query and visualize it. You can also take advantage of Log Analytic's built-in solutions to immediately gain insights into the security and functionality of your infrastructure.

## Accessing monitoring in the Azure portal
All Azure monitoring services are now available in a single UI pane. For more information on how to access this area, see [Get started with Azure Monitor](monitoring-get-started.md). 

You can also access monitoring functions for specific Azure resources by highlighting those resources and drilling down into their monitoring options. 

## Examples of when to use which tool 

The following sections show some basic scenarios and which tools should be used together. 

### Scenario 1 – Fix errors in an Azure application under development   

**The best option is to use Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Visual Studio together**

Azure now provides the full power of the Visual Studio debugger in the cloud. Configure Azure Monitor to send telemetry to Application Insights. Enable Visual Studio to include the Application Insights SDK in your application. Once in Application Insights, you can use the Application Map to discover visually which parts of your running application are healthy or not. For those parts that are not healthy, errors and exceptions are already available for exploration. You can use the various analytics in Application Insights to go deeper. If you are not sure about the error, you can use the Visual Studio debugger to trace into code and pin point a problem further. 

For more information, see [Monitoring Web Apps](../application-insights/app-insights-azure-web-apps.md) and refer to the table of contents on the left for instructions on various types of apps and languages.  

### Scenario 2 – Debug an Azure .NET web application for errors that only show in production 

> [!NOTE]
> These features are in preview. 

**The best option is to use Application Insights and if possible Visual Studio for the full debugging experience.**

Use the Application Insights Snapshot Debugger to debug your app. When a certain error threshold occurs with production components, the system automatically captures telemetry in windows of time called “snapshots." The amount captured is safe for a production cloud because it’s small enough not to affect performance but significant enough to allow tracing.  The system can capture multiple snapshots. You can look at a point in time in the Azure portal or use Visual Studio for the full experience. With Visual Studio, developers can walk through that snapshot as if they were debugging in real-time. Local variables, parameters, memory, and frames are all available. Developers must be granted access to this production data via an [RBAC role](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md).  

For more information, see [Snapshot debugging](../application-insights/app-insights-snapshot-debugger.md). 

### Scenario 3 – Debug an Azure application that uses containers or microservices 

**Same as scenario 1. Use Application Insights, Azure Monitor, and Visual Studio together**

Application Insights also supports gathering telemetry from processes running inside containers and from microservices (Kubernetes, Docker, Azure Service Fabric). For more information, [see this video on debugging containers and microservices](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848184). 


### Scenario 4 – Fix performance issues in your Azure application

The [Application Insights profiler](../application-insights/app-insights-profiler.md) is designed to help troubleshoot these types of issues. You can identify and troubleshoot performance issues for applications running in App Services (Web Apps, Logic Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps, Function Apps) and other compute resources such as Virtual Machines, Virtual machine scale sets (VMSS), Cloud Services, and Service Fabric. 

> [!NOTE]
> Ability to profile Virtual Machines, Virtual machine scale sets (VMSS), Cloud Services and Services Fabric is in preview.   

In addition, you are proactively notified by email about certain types of errors, such as slow page load times, by the Smart Detection tool.  You don’t need to do any configuration on this tool. For more information, see [Smart Detection - Performance Anomalies](../application-insights/app-insights-proactive-performance-diagnostics.md).
