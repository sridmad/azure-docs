# Create metric alerts in Azure Monitor for Azure services - Azure portal

## Overview
This article shows you how to set up Azure metric alerts using the Azure portal. 

You can receive an alert based on monitoring metrics for, or events on, your Azure services.

* **Metric values** - The alert triggers when the value of a specified metric crosses a threshold you assign in either direction. That is, it triggers both when the condition is first met and then afterwards when that condition is no longer being met.    
* **Activity log events** - An alert can trigger on *every* event, or, only when certain events occurs. Learn more about [activity log alerts](monitoring-activity-log-alerts.md).

You can configure a metric alert to do the following when it triggers:

* send email notifications to the service administrator and co-administrators
* send email to additional emails that you specify.
* call a webhook
* start execution of an Azure runbook (only from the Azure portal)

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor now supports Near Real-Time Metric Alerts in public preview. These use Action Groups. Learn more about [Near Real-Time Metric Alerts](monitoring-near-real-time-metric-alerts.md).

You can configure and get information about metric alert rules using

* [Azure portal](insights-alerts-portal.md)
* [PowerShell](insights-alerts-powershell.md)
* [command-line interface (CLI)](insights-alerts-command-line-interface.md)
* [Azure Monitor REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn931945.aspx)

## Create an alert rule on a metric with the Azure portal
1. In the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/), locate the resource you are interested in monitoring and select it.

2. Select **Alerts** or **Alert rules** under the MONITORING section. The text and icon may vary slightly for different resources.

3. Select the **Add alert** command and fill in the fields.

4. **Name** your alert rule, and choose a **Description**, which also shows in notification emails.

5. Select the **Metric** you want to monitor, then choose a **Condition** and **Threshold** value for the metric. Also choose the **Period** of time that the metric rule must be satisfied before the alert triggers. So for example, if you use the period "Over the last 5 minutes" and your alert looks for CPU above 80%, the alert triggers when the CPU has been consistently above 80% for 5 minutes. Once the first trigger occurs, it again triggers when the CPU stays below 80% for 5 minutes. The CPU metric measurement occurs every one minute.

6. Check **Email owners...** if you want administrators and co-administrators to be emailed when the alert fires.

7. If you want additional emails to receive a notification when the alert fires, add them in the **Additional Administrator email(s)** field. Separate multiple emails with semi-colons - *email@contoso.com;email2@contoso.com*

8. Put in a valid URI in the **Webhook** field if you want it called when the alert fires.

9. If you use Azure Automation, you can select a Runbook to be run when the alert fires.

10. Select **OK** when done to create the alert.   

Within a few minutes, the alert is active and triggers as previously described.

## Managing your alerts
Once you have created an alert, you can select it and:

* View a graph showing the metric threshold and the actual values from the previous day.
* Edit or delete it.
* **Disable** or **Enable** it if you want to temporarily stop or resume receiving notifications for that alert.
