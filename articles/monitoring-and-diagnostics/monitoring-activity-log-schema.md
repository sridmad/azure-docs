# Azure Activity Log event schema
The **Azure Activity Log** is a log that provides insight into any subscription-level events that have occurred in Azure. This article describes the event schema per category of data.

## Administrative
This category contains the record of all create, update, delete, and action operations performed through Resource Manager. Examples of the types of events you would see in this category include "create virtual machine" and "delete network security group" Every action taken by a user or application using Resource Manager is modeled as an operation on a particular resource type. If the operation type is Write, Delete, or Action, the records of both the start and success or fail of that operation are recorded in the Administrative category. The Administrative category also includes any changes to role-based access control in a subscription.

### Sample event

## Service health
This category contains the record of any service health incidents that have occurred in Azure. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "SQL Azure in East US is experiencing downtime." Service health events come in five varieties: Action Required, Assisted Recovery, Incident, Maintenance, Information, or Security, and only appear if you have a resource in the subscription that would be impacted by the event.

## Alert
This category contains the record of all activations of Azure alerts. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "CPU % on myVM has been over 80 for the past 5 minutes." A variety of Azure systems have an alerting concept -- you can define a rule of some sort and receive a notification when conditions match that rule. Each time a supported Azure alert type 'activates,' or the conditions are met to generate a notification, a record of the activation is also pushed to this category of the Activity Log.

## Autoscale
This category contains the record of any events related to the operation of the autoscale engine based on any autoscale settings you have defined in your subscription. An example of the type of event you would see in this category is "Autoscale scale up action failed." Using autoscale, you can automatically scale out or scale in the number of instances in a supported resource type based on time of day and/or load (metric) data using an autoscale setting. When the conditions are met to scale up or down, the start and succeeded or failed events will be recorded in this category.
