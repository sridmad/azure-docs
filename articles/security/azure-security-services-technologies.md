# Azure Security Services and Technologies
In our discussions with current and future Azure customers, we’re often asked “do you have a list of all the security related services and technologies that Azure has to offer?”

When evaluating cloud service provider options, it’s helpful to have this information.

The following is our initial effort at providing a list. Over time, this list will change and grow, just as Azure does. The list is categorized, and the list of categories will also grow over time.
