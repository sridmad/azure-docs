# Azure SQL Data Warehouse performance tiers (Preview)
SQL Data Warehouse offers two performance tiers that are optimized for analytical workloads. This article explains the concepts of performance tiers to help you choose the most suitable performance tier for your workload. 


## What is a performance tier?
A performance tier is an option that determines the configuration of your data warehouse. This option is one of the first choices you make when creating a data warehouse.  

- The **Optimized for Elasticity performance tier** separates the compute and storage layers in the architecture. This option excels on workloads that can take full advantage of the separation between compute and storage by scaling frequently to support short periods of peak activity. This compute tier has the lowest entry price point and scales to support the majority of customer workloads.

- The **Optimized for Compute performance tier** uses the latest Azure hardware to introduce a new NVMe Solid State Disk cache that keeps the most frequently accessed data close to the CPUs, which is exactly where you want it. By automatically tiering the storage, this performance tier excels with complex queries since all IO is kept local to the compute layer. Furthermore, the columnstore is enhanced to store an unlimited amount of data in your SQL Data Warehouse. The Optimized for Compute performance tier provides the greatest level of scalability, enabling you to scale up to 30,000 compute Data Warehouse Units (cDWU). Choose this tier for workloads that requires continuous, blazing fast, performance.

## Service levels
The Service Level Objective (SLO) is the scalability setting that determines the cost and performance level of your data warehouse. The service levels for the Optimized for Compute performance tier scale are measured in compute data warehouse units (cDWU), for example DW2000c. The Optimized for Elasticity service levels are measured in DWUs, for example DW2000. For more information, see [What is a data warehouse unit?](what-is-a-data-warehouse-unit-dwu-cdwu.md)

In T-SQL the SERVICE_OBJECTIVE setting determines the service level and the performance tier for your data warehouse.

```sql
--Optimized for Elasticity
CREATE DATABASE myElasticSQLDW
WITH
(    SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'DW1000'
)
;

--Optimized for Compute
CREATE DATABASE myComputeSQLDW
WITH
(    SERVICE_OBJECTIVE = 'DW1000c'
)
;
```

## Memory maximums
The performance tiers have different memory profiles, which translates into a different amount of memory per query. The Optimized for Compute performance tier provides 2.5x more memory per query than the Optimized for Elasticity performance tier. This extra memory helps the Optimized for Compute performance tier deliver its blazing fast performance. Additional memory per query also allows you to run more queries concurrently since queries can use lower [resource classes](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md). 

### Optimized for Elasticity

The service levels for the Optimized for Elasticity performance tier range from DW100 to DW6000.

The maximum cDWU is DW30000c, which has 60 Compute nodes and one distribution per Compute node. For example, a 600 TB data warehouse at DW30000c processes approximately 10 TB per Compute node.

## Concurrency maximums
SQL Data Warehouse provides industry-leading concurrency on a single data warehouse. To ensure each query has enough resources to execute efficiently, the system tracks compute resource utilization by assigning concurrency slots to each query. The system puts queries into a queue where they wait until enough concurrency slots are available. 

Concurrency slots also determine CPU prioritization. For more information, see [Analyze your workload](analyze-your-workload.md)

### Concurrency slots
Concurrency slots are a convenient way to track the resources available for query execution. They are like tickets that you purchase to reserve seats at a concert because seating is limited. Similarly, SQL Data Warehouse has a finite number of compute resources. Queries reserve compute resources by acquiring concurrency slots. Before a query can start executing, it must be able to reserve enough concurrency slots. When a query finishes, it releases its concurrency slots. 

* The optimized for elasticity performance tier scales to 240 concurrency slots.
* The optimized for compute performance tier scales to 1200 concurrency slots.

Each query will consume zero, one, or more concurrency slots. System queries and some trivial queries do not consume any slots. By default, queries that are governed by resource classes require one concurrency slot. More complex queries can require additional concurrency slots.  

- A query running with 10 concurrency slots can access 5 times more compute resources than a query running with 2 concurrency slots.
- If each query requires 10 concurrency slots and there are 40 concurrency slots, then only 4 queries can run concurrently.
 
Only resource governed queries consume concurrency slots. The exact number of concurrency slots consumed is determined by the query's [resource class](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md).

### Optimized for Compute
The following table shows the maximum concurrent queries and concurrency slots for each [dynamic resource class](resource-classes-for-workload-management.md).  These apply to the Optimized for Compute performance tier.

When one of these thresholds is met, new queries are queued and executed on a first-in, first-out basis.  As a queries finishes and the number of queries and slots fall below the limits, SQL Data Warehouse releases queued queries.
