# Windows Authentication and Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server
Use the Windows Authentication section of the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server to enable and configure Windows authentication for applications. Before you set up Windows Authentication, keep the following list in mind:

* After setup, reboot the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Terminal Services to take effect.
* If ‘Require Azure Multi-Factor Authentication user match’ is checked and you are not in the user list, you will not be able to log into the machine after reboot.
* Trusted IPs is dependent on whether the application can provide the client IP with the authentication. Currently only Terminal Services is supported.  

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not supported to secure Terminal Services on Windows Server 2012 R2.

## To secure an application with Windows Authentication, use the following procedure.
1. In the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server click the Windows Authentication icon.
   ![Windows Authentication](./media/multi-factor-authentication-get-started-server-windows/windowsauth.png)
2. Check the **Enable Windows Authentication** checkbox. By default, this box is unchecked.
3. The Applications tab allows the administrator to configure one or more applications for Windows Authentication.
4. Select a server or application – specify whether the server/application is enabled. Click **OK**.
5. Click **Add…**
6. The Trusted IPs tab allows you to skip Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for Windows sessions originating from specific IPs. For example, if employees use the application from the office and from home, you may decide you don't want their phones ringing for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication while at the office. For this, you would specify the office subnet as Trusted IPs entry.
7. Click **Add…**
8. Select **Single IP** if you would like to skip a single IP address.
9. Select **IP Range** if you would like to skip an entire IP range. Example 10.63.193.1-10.63.193.100.
10. Select **Subnet** if you would like to specify a range of IPs using subnet notation. Enter the subnet's starting IP and pick the appropriate netmask from the drop-down list.
11. Click **OK**.
