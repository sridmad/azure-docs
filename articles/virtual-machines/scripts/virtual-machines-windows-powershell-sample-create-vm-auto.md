# Create a fully configured virtual machine with the New-AzVM PowerShell cmdlet (preview)

This script uses the New-AzVM cmdlet in Cloud Shell to create an Azure Virtual Machine running Windows Server 2016. After running the script, you can access the virtual machine over RDP. Cloud Shell has the module that includes New-AzVM installed by default, which makes it easier for you to check out the new functionality.

This sample uses the New-AzVM cmdlet, which is in preview.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-powershell.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-powershell.md)]

## Sample script


```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzVM -Name myVM `
	-VirtualNetworkName myVNet `
	-Location westeurope `
	-SecurityGroupName myNSG `
	-PublicIpAddressName myPIP 
```


## Clean up deployment 

Run the following command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myVMResourceGroup
```
