# Copy snapshot of a managed disk in same subscription or different subscription with PowerShell

This script creates a copy of a snapshot in the same same subscription or different subscription. Use this script to move a snapshot to different subscription for data retention. Storing snapshots in different subscription protect you from accidental deletion of snapshots in your main subscription. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-powershell-install](../../../includes/sample-powershell-install.md)]

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/virtual-machine/copy-snapshot-to-same-or-different-subscription/copy-snapshot-to-same-or-different-subscription.ps1 "Copy snapshot")]


## Script explanation

This script uses following commands to create a snapshot in the target subscription using the Id of the source snapshot. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [New-AzureRmSnapshotConfig](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/New-AzureRmSnapshotConfig) | Creates snapshot configuration that is used for snapshot creation. It includes the resource Id of the parent snapshot and location that is same as the parent snapshot.  |
| [New-AzureRmSnapshot](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/New-AzureRmDisk) | Creates a snapshot using snapshot configuration, snapshot name, and resource group name passed as parameters. |
