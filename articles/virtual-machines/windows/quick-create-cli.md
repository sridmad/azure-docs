# Create a Windows virtual machine with the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This quickstart details using the Azure CLI to deploy a virtual machine running Windows Server 2016. Once deployment is complete, we connect to the server and install IIS.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.


[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 


## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_create). 

The following example creates a VM named *myVM*. This example uses *azureuser* for an administrative user name and *myPassword12* as the password. Update these values to something appropriate to your environment. These values are needed when creating a connection with the virtual machine.

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser --admin-password myPassword12
```

When the VM has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example. Take note of the `publicIpAaddress`. This address is used to access the VM.

```azurecli-interactive 
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.174.34.95",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

## Open port 80 for web traffic 

By default only RDP connections are allowed in to Windows virtual machines deployed in Azure. If this VM is going to be a webserver, you need to open port 80 from the Internet. Use the [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm#open-port) command to open the desired port.  
 
 ```azurecli-interactive  
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```


## Connect to virtual machine

Use the following command to create a remote desktop session with the virtual machine. Replace the IP address with the public IP address of your virtual machine. When prompted, enter the credentials used when creating the virtual machine.

```bash 
mstsc /v:Public IP Address
```

## Install IIS using PowerShell

Now that you have logged in to the Azure VM, you can use a single line of PowerShell to install IIS and enable the local firewall rule to allow web traffic. Open a PowerShell prompt and run the following command:

```powershell
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
```

## View the IIS welcome page

With IIS installed and port 80 now open on your VM from the Internet, you can use a web browser of your choice to view the default IIS welcome page. Be sure to use the public IP address you documented above to visit the default page.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quick start, youâ€™ve deployed a simple virtual machine, a network security group rule, and installed a web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Windows VMs.
