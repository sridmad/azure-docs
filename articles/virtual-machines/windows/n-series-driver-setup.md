# Set up GPU drivers for N-series VMs running Windows Server
To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs running Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2, install supported NVIDIA graphics drivers. This article provides driver setup steps after you deploy an N-series VM. Driver setup information is also available for [Linux VMs](../linux/n-series-driver-setup.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

For basic specs, storage capacities, and disk details, see [GPU Windows VM sizes](sizes-gpu.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). 


[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-n-series-windows-support](../../../includes/virtual-machines-n-series-windows-support.md)]



## Driver installation

1. Connect by Remote Desktop to each N-series VM.

2. Download, extract, and install the supported driver for your Windows operating system.

On Azure NV VMs, a restart is required after driver installation. On NC VMs, a restart is not required.

## Verify driver installation

You can verify driver installation in Device Manager. The following example shows successful configuration of the Tesla K80 card on an Azure NC VM.

To query the GPU device state, run the [nvidia-smi](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) command-line utility installed with the driver.

1. Open a command prompt and change to the **C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVSMI** directory.

2. Run `nvidia-smi`. If the driver is installed you will see output similar to the following. Note that **GPU-Util** shows **0%** unless you are currently running a GPU workload on the VM. Your driver version and GPU details may be different from the ones shown.

## RDMA network for NC24r VMs

RDMA network connectivity can be enabled on NC24r VMs deployed in the same availability set. The HpcVmDrivers extension must be added to install Windows network device drivers that enable RDMA connectivity. To add the VM extension to an NC24r VM, use [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview) cmdlets for Azure Resource Manager.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, only Windows Server 2012 R2 supports the RDMA network on NC24r VMs.
> 

To install the latest version 1.1 HpcVMDrivers extension on an existing RDMA-capable VM named myVM in the West US region:
  ```PowerShell
  Set-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Location "westus" -VMName "myVM" -ExtensionName "HpcVmDrivers" -Publisher "Microsoft.HpcCompute" -Type "HpcVmDrivers" -TypeHandlerVersion "1.1"
  ```
  For more information, see [Virtual machine extensions and features for Windows](extensions-features.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2fclassic%2ftoc.json).

The RDMA network supports Message Passing Interface (MPI) traffic for applications running with [Microsoft MPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb524831(v=vs.85).aspx) or Intel MPI 5.x. 


## Next steps

* For more information about the NVIDIA GPUs on the N-series VMs, see:
    * [NVIDIA Tesla K80](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-k80.html) (for Azure NC VMs)
    * [NVIDIA Tesla M60](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-m60.html) (for Azure NV VMs)

* Developers building GPU-accelerated applications for the NVIDIA Tesla GPUs can also download and install the CUDA Toolkit 8 for [Windows Server 2016](https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/Prod2/local_installers/cuda_8.0.61_win10-exe) or [Windows Server 2012 R2](https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/8.0/Prod2/local_installers/cuda_8.0.61_windows-exe). For more information, see the [CUDA Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#axzz4ZcwJvqYi).
