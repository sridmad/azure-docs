# Deploy OpenShift Container Platform in Azure

You can use one of several methods to deploy OpenShift Container Platform in Azure:

- You can manually deploy the necessary Azure infrastructure components and then follow the OpenShift Container Platform [documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.6/welcome/index.html).
- You can also use an existing [Resource Manager template](https://github.com/Microsoft/openshift-container-platform/) that simplifies the deployment of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
- Another option is to use the [Azure Marketplace offer](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/redhat.openshift-container-platform?tab=Overview).

For all options, a Red Hat subscription is required. During the deployment, the Red Hat Enterprise Linux instance is registered to the Red Hat subscription and attached to the Pool ID that contains the entitlements for OpenShift Container Platform.
Ensure that you have a valid Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) username, password, and Pool ID. You can verify this information by signing in to https://access.redhat.com.

## Deploy by using the OpenShift Container Platform Resource Manager template

To deploy by using the Resource Manager template, you use a parameters file to supply the input parameters. To customize any of the deployment items that are not covered by using input parameters, fork the GitHub repo and change the appropriate items.

Some common customization options include, but are not limited to:

- Virtual network CIDR (variable in azuredeploy.json)
- Bastion VM size (variable in azuredeploy.json)
- Naming conventions (variables in azuredeploy.json)
- OpenShift cluster specifics, modified via hosts file (deployOpenShift.sh)

### Configure the parameters file

Use the `appId` value from the service principal you created earlier for the `aadClientId` parameter. 

The following example creates a parameters file named azuredeploy.parameters.json with all the required inputs.

```json
{
	"$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
	"contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
	"parameters": {
		"masterVmSize": {
			"value": "Standard_E2s_v3"
		},
		"infraVmSize": {
			"value": "Standard_E2s_v3"
		},
		"nodeVmSize": {
			"value": "Standard_E2s_v3"
		},
		"openshiftClusterPrefix": {
			"value": "mycluster"
		},
		"masterInstanceCount": {
			"value": 3
		},
		"infraInstanceCount": {
			"value": 2
		},
		"nodeInstanceCount": {
			"value": 2
		},
		"dataDiskSize": {
			"value": 128
		},
		"adminUsername": {
			"value": "clusteradmin"
		},
		"openshiftPassword": {
			"value": "{Strong Password}"
		},
		"enableMetrics": {
			"value": "true"
		},
		"enableLogging": {
			"value": "true"
		},
		"enableCockpit": {
			"value": "false"
		},
		"rhsmUsernamePasswordOrActivationKey": {
			"value": "usernamepassword"
		},
		"rhsmUsernameOrOrgId": {
			"value": "{RHSM Username}"
		},
		"rhsmPasswordOrActivationKey": {
			"value": "{RHSM Password}"
		},
		"rhsmPoolId": {
			"value": "{Pool ID}"
		},
		"sshPublicKey": {
			"value": "{SSH Public Key}"
		},
		"keyVaultResourceGroup": {
			"value": "keyvaultrg"
		},
		"keyVaultName": {
			"value": "keyvault"
		},
		"keyVaultSecret": {
			"value": "keysecret"
		},
		"enableAzure": {
			"value": "true"
		},
		"aadClientId": {
			"value": "11111111-abcd-1234-efgh-111111111111"
		},
		"aadClientSecret": {
			"value": "{Strong Password}"
		},
		"defaultSubDomainType": {
			"value": "nipio"
		}
	}
}
```

Replace the items enclosed in brackets with your specific information.

### Deploy by using Azure CLI

> [!NOTE] 
> The following command requires Azure CLI 2.0.8 or later. You can verify the CLI version with the `az --version` command. To update the CLI version, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latesti).

The following example deploys the OpenShift cluster and all related resources into a resource group named myResourceGroup, with a deployment name of myOpenShiftCluster. The template is referenced directly from the GitHub repo, and a local parameters file named azuredeploy.parameters.json file is used.

```azurecli 
az group deployment create -g myResourceGroup --name myOpenShiftCluster \
      --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/openshift-container-platform/master/azuredeploy.json \
      --parameters @./azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

The deployment takes at least 30 minutes to complete, depending on the total number of nodes deployed. The URL of the OpenShift console and the DNS name of the OpenShift master prints to the terminal when the deployment finishes.

```json
{
  "OpenShift Console Uri": "http://openshiftlb.cloudapp.azure.com:8443/console",
  "OpenShift Master SSH": "ssh clusteradmin@myopenshiftmaster.cloudapp.azure.com -p 2200"
}
```

## Deploy by using the OpenShift Container Platform Azure Marketplace offer

The simplest way to deploy OpenShift Container Platform into Azure is to use the [Azure Marketplace offer](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/redhat.openshift-container-platform?tab=Overview).

This is the simplest option, but it also has limited customization capabilities. The offer includes three configuration options:

- **Small**: Deploys a non-high availability (HA) cluster with one master node, one infrastructure node, two application nodes, and one bastion node. All nodes are standard DS2v2 VM sizes. This cluster requires 10 total cores and is ideal for small-scale testing.
- **Medium**: Deploys an HA cluster with three master nodes, two infrastructure nodes, four application nodes, and one bastion node. All nodes except the bastion node are standard DS3v2 VM sizes. The bastion node is a standard DS2v2. This cluster requires 38 cores.
- **Large**: Deploys an HA cluster with three master nodes, two infrastructure nodes, six application nodes, and one bastion node. The master and infrastructure nodes are standard DS3v2 VM sizes. The application nodes are standard DS4v2 VM sizes, and the bastion node is a standard DS2v2. This cluster requires 70 cores.

Configuration of Azure Cloud Solution Provider is optional for medium and large cluster sizes. The small cluster size does not give an option for configuring Azure Cloud Solution Provider.

## Connect to the OpenShift cluster

When the deployment finishes, connect to the OpenShift console with your browser by using the `OpenShift Console Uri`. Alternatively, you can connect to the OpenShift master by using the following command:

```bash
$ ssh clusteradmin@myopenshiftmaster.cloudapp.azure.com -p 2200
```

## Clean up resources

Use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) command to remove the resource group, OpenShift cluster, and all related resources when they're no longer needed.

```azurecli 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
