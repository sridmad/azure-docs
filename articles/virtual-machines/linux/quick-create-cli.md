# Create a Linux virtual machine with the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This quickstart details using the Azure CLI to deploy a virtual machine running Ubuntu server. Once the server is deployed, an SSH connection is created, and an NGINX webserver is installed.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a VM with the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az_vm_create) command. 

The following example creates a VM named *myVM* and creates SSH keys if they do not already exist in a default key location. To use a specific set of keys, use the `--ssh-key-value` option.  

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
```

When the VM has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example. Take note of the `publicIpAddress`. This address is used to access the VM.

```azurecli-interactive 
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

## Open port 80 for web traffic 

By default only SSH connections are allowed into Linux virtual machines deployed in Azure. If this VM is going to be a webserver, you need to open port 80 from the Internet. Use the [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm#open-port) command to open the desired port.  
 
 ```azurecli-interactive 
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

## SSH into your VM

Use the following command to create an SSH session with the virtual machine. Make sure to replace *<publicIpAddress>* with the correct public IP address of your virtual machine.  In our example above our IP address was *40.68.254.142*.

```bash 
ssh <publicIpAddress>
```

## Install NGINX

Use the following commands to update package sources and install the latest NGINX package. 

```bash 
# update package source
sudo apt-get -y update

# install NGINX
sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

## View the NGINX welcome page

With NGINX installed and port 80 now open on your VM from the Internet - you can use a web browser of your choice to view the default NGINX welcome page. Be sure to use the *publicIpAddress* you documented above to visit the default page.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) command to remove the resource group, VM, and all related resources. Exit the SSH session to your VM, then delete the resources as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

In this quick start, youâ€™ve deployed a simple virtual machine, a network security group rule, and installed a web server. To learn more about Azure virtual machines, continue to the tutorial for Linux VMs.
