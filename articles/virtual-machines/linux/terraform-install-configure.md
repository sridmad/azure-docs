# Install and configure Terraform to provision VMs and other infrastructure into Azure
 
Terraform provides an easy way to define, preview, and deploy cloud infrastructure by using a [simple templating language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html). This article describes the necessary steps to use Terraform to provision resources in Azure. 

> [!TIP]
To learn more about how to use Terraform with Azure, visit the [Terraform Hub](/azure/terraform). Terraform is installed by default in the [Cloud Shell](/terraform/terraform-cloud-shell). By using Cloud Shell, you can skip the install/setup portions of this document.

## Install Terraform

To install Terraform, [download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) the package appropriate for your operating system into a separate install directory. The download contains a single executable file, for which you should also define a global path. For instructions on how to set the path on Linux and Mac, go to [this webpage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux). For instructions on how to set the path on Windows, go to [this webpage](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows). 

Verify your path configuration with the `terraform` command. You should see a list of available Terraform options as output:

```bash
azureuser@Azure:~$ terraform
Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] <command> [args]
```

## Set up Terraform access to Azure

Configure [an Azure AD service principal](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) to enable Terraform to provision resources into Azure. The service principal grants your Terraform scripts using credentials to provision resources in your Azure subscription.

There are several ways to create an Azure AD application and an Azure AD service principal. The easiest and fastest way today is to use Azure CLI 2.0, which [you can download and install on Windows, Linux, or a Mac](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

Sign in to administer your Azure subscription by issuing the following command:

   `az login`

If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, their details are returned by the `az login` command. Set the `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable to hold the value of the returned `id` field from the subscription you want to use. 

Set the subscription that you want to use for this session.

```azurecli-interactive
az account set --subscription="${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```

Query the account to get the subscription ID and tenant ID values.

```azurecli-interactive
az account show --query "{subscriptionId:id, tenantId:tenantId}"
```

Next, create separate credentials for Terraform.

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```

Your appId, password, sp_name, and tenant are returned. Make a note of the appId and password.

To test your credentials, open a new shell and run the following command, using the returned values for sp_name, password, and tenant:

```azurecli-interactive
az login --service-principal -u SP_NAME -p PASSWORD --tenant TENANT
az vm list-sizes --location westus
```

## Configure Terraform environment variables

Configure Terraform to use the tenant ID, subscription ID, client ID, and client secret from the service principal when creating Azure resources. Set the following environment variables, which are used automatically by the [Azure Terraform modules](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure).

- ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
- ARM_CLIENT_ID
- ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
- ARM_TENANT_ID

You can use this sample shell script to set those variables:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
echo "Setting environment variables for Terraform"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your_subscription_id
export ARM_CLIENT_ID=your_appId
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_password
export ARM_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
```

## Run a sample script

Create a file `test.tf` in an empty directory and paste in the following script. 

```tf
provider "azurerm" {
}
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
        name = "testResourceGroup"
        location = "westus"
}
```

Save the file and then run `terraform init`. This command downloads the Azure modules required to create an Azure resource group. You see the following output:

```
* provider.azurerm: version = "~> 0.3"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Preview the script with `terraform plan`, and then create the `testResouceGroup` resource group with `terraform apply`:

```
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  + azurerm_resource_group.rg
      id:       <computed>
      location: "westus"
      name:     "testResourceGroup"
      tags.%:   <computed>

azurerm_resource_group.rg: Creating...
  location: "" => "westus"
  name:     "" => "testResourceGroup"
  tags.%:   "" => "<computed>"
azurerm_resource_group.rg: Creation complete after 1s
```

## Next steps

You have installed Terraform and configured Azure credentials so that you can start deploying infrastructure into your Azure subscription. You then tested your installation by creating an empty Azure resource group.
