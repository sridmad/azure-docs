# Detailed walk through to create an SSH key pair and additional certificates for a Linux VM in Azure
With an SSH key pair, you can create Virtual Machines on Azure that default to using SSH keys for authentication, eliminating the need for passwords to log in. Passwords can be guessed, and open your VMs up to relentless brute force attempts to guess your password. VMs created with the Azure CLI or Resource Manager templates can include your SSH public key as part of the deployment, removing a post deployment configuration step of disabling password logins for SSH. This article provides detailed steps and additional examples of generating certificates, such as for use with Linux virtual machines. If you want to quickly create and use an SSH key pair, see [How to create an SSH public and private key pair for Linux VMs in Azure](mac-create-ssh-keys.md).

## Understanding SSH keys

Using SSH public and private keys is the easiest way to log in to your Linux servers. [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) provides a much more secure way to log in to your Linux or BSD VM in Azure than passwords, which can be brute-forced far more easily.

Your public key can be shared with anyone; but only you (or your local security infrastructure) possess your private key.  The SSH private key should have a [very secure password](https://www.xkcd.com/936/) (source:[xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com)) to safeguard it.  This password is just to access the private SSH key file and **is not** the user account password.  When you add a password to your SSH key, it encrypts the private key using 128-bit AES, so that the private key is useless without the password to decrypt it.  If an attacker stole your private key and that key did not have a password, they would be able to use that private key to log in to any servers that have the corresponding public key.  If a private key is password protected it cannot be used by that attacker, providing an additional layer of security for your infrastructure on Azure.

This article creates an SSH protocol version 2 RSA public and private key file pair (also referred to as "ssh-rsa" keys), which are recommended for deployments with Azure Resource Manager. *ssh-rsa* keys are required on the [portal](https://portal.azure.com) for both classic and Resource Manager deployments.

## SSH keys use and benefits

Azure requires at least 2048-bit, SSH protocol version 2 RSA format public and private keys; the public key file has the `.pub` container format. To create the keys use `ssh-keygen`, which asks a series of questions and then writes a private key and a matching public key. When an Azure VM is created, Azure copies the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` folder on the VM. SSH keys in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` are used to challenge the client to match the corresponding private key on an SSH login connection.  When an Azure Linux VM is created using SSH keys for authentication, Azure configures the SSHD server to not allow password logins, only SSH keys.  Therefore, by creating Azure Linux VMs with SSH keys, you can help secure the VM deployment and save yourself the typical post-deployment configuration step of disabling passwords in the **sshd_config** file.

## Using ssh-keygen

This command creates a password secured (encrypted) SSH key pair using 2048-bit RSA and it is commented to easily identify it.  

SSH keys are by default kept in the `~/.ssh` directory.  If you do not have a `~/.ssh` directory, the `ssh-keygen` command creates it for you with the correct permissions.

```bash
ssh-keygen \
    -t rsa \
    -b 2048 \
    -C "azureuser@myserver" \
    -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
    -N mypassword
```

*Command explained*

`ssh-keygen` = the program used to create the keys

`-t rsa` = type of key to create which is the [RSA format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
`-b 2048` = bits of the key

`-C "azureuser@myserver"` = a comment appended to the end of the public key file to easily identify it.  Normally an email is used as the comment but you can use whatever works best for your infrastructure.

## Classic deploy using `asm`

If you are using the classic deployment model (`asm` mode in the CLI), you can use an SSH-RSA public key or an RFC4716 formatted key in a pem container.  The SSH-RSA public key is what was created earlier in this article using `ssh-keygen`.

To create a RFC4716 formatted key from an existing SSH public key:

```bash
ssh-keygen \
-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
-e \
-m RFC4716 > ~/.ssh/id_ssh2.pem
```

## Example of ssh-keygen

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "azureuser@myserver"
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/azureuser/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/azureuser/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/azureuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
14:a3:cb:3e:78:ad:25:cc:55:e9:0c:08:e5:d1:a9:08 azureuser@myserver

Saved key files:

`Enter file in which to save the key (/home/azureuser/.ssh/id_rsa): ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

The key pair name for this article.  Having a key pair named **id_rsa** is the default and some tools might expect the **id_rsa** private key file name so having one is a good idea. The directory `~/.ssh/` is the default location for SSH key pairs and the SSH config file.  If not specified with a full path, `ssh-keygen` creates the keys in the current working directory, not the default `~/.ssh`.

A listing of the `~/.ssh` directory.

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
-rw------- 1 azureuser staff  1675 Aug 25 18:04 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 azureuser staff   410 Aug 25 18:04 id_rsa.pub
```

Key Password:

`Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):`

`ssh-keygen` refers to a password for the private key file as "a passphrase."  It is *strongly* recommended to add a password to your private key. Without a password protecting the key file, anyone with the file can use it to log in to any server that has the corresponding public key. Adding a password (passphrase) offers more protection in case someone is able to gain access to your private key file, given you time to change the keys used to authenticate you.

## Using ssh-agent to store your private key password

To avoid typing your private key file password with every SSH login, you can use `ssh-agent` to cache your private key file password. If you are using a Mac, the OSX Keychain securely stores the private key passwords when you invoke `ssh-agent`.

Verify and use ssh-agent and ssh-add to inform the SSH system about the key files so that the passphrase will not need to be used interactively.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

Now add the private key to `ssh-agent` using the command `ssh-add`.

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

The private key password is now stored in `ssh-agent`.

## Using `ssh-copy-id` to copy the key to an existing VM
If you have already created a VM you can install the new SSH public key to your Linux VM with:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ahmet@myserver
```

## Create and configure an SSH config file

It is a recommended best practice to create and configure an `~/.ssh/config` file to speed up log ins and for optimizing your SSH client behavior.

The following example shows a standard configuration.

### Create the file

```bash
touch ~/.ssh/config
```

### Edit the file to add the new SSH configuration:

```bash
vim ~/.ssh/config
```

### Example `~/.ssh/config` file:

```bash
# Azure Keys
Host fedora22
  Hostname 102.160.203.241
  User ahmet
# ./Azure Keys
# Default Settings
Host *
  PubkeyAuthentication=yes
  IdentitiesOnly=yes
  ServerAliveInterval=60
  ServerAliveCountMax=30
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/SSHConnections/ssh-%r@%h:%p
  ControlPersist 4h
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This SSH config gives you sections for each server to enable each to have its own dedicated key pair. The default settings (`Host *`) are for any hosts that do not match any of the specific hosts higher up in the config file.

### Config file explained

`Host` = the name of the host being called on the terminal.  `ssh fedora22` tells `SSH` to use the values in the settings block labeled `Host fedora22`  NOTE: Host can be any label that is logical for your usage and does not represent the actual hostname of any server.

`Hostname 102.160.203.241` = the IP address or DNS name for the server being accessed.

`User ahmet` = the remote user account to use when logging in to the server.

`PubKeyAuthentication yes` = tells SSH you want to use an SSH key to log in.

`IdentityFile /home/ahmet/.ssh/id_id_rsa` = the SSH private key and corresponding public key to use for authentication.

## SSH into Linux without a password

Now that you have an SSH key pair and a configured SSH config file, you are able to log in to your Linux VM quickly and securely. The first time you log in to a server using an SSH key the command prompts you for the passphrase for that key file.

```bash
ssh fedora22
```

### Command explained

When `ssh fedora22` is executed SSH first locates and loads any settings from the `Host fedora22` block, and then loads all the remaining settings from the last block, `Host *`.

## Next Steps

Next up is to create Azure Linux VMs using the new SSH public key.  Azure VMs that are created with an SSH public key as the login are better secured than VMs created with the default login method, passwords.  Azure VMs created using SSH keys are by default configured with passwords disabled, avoiding brute-forced guessing attempts.
