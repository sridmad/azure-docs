# What are Azure SQL Database service tiers

[Azure SQL Database](sql-database-technical-overview.md) offers **Basic**, **Standard**, **Premium**, and **Premium RS** service tiers for both [single databases](sql-database-single-database-resources.md) and [elastic pools](sql-database-elastic-pool.md). Service tiers are primarily differentiated by a range of performance level and storage size choices, and price.  All service tiers provide flexibility in changing performance level and storage size.  Single databases and elastic pools are billed hourly based on service tier, performance level, and storage size.   

## Choosing a service tier

Choosing a service tier depends primarily on business continuity, storage, and performance requirements.
| | **Basic** | **Standard** |**Premium** |**Premium RS** |
| :-- | --: |--:| --:| --:| 
|Target workload|Development and production|Development and production|Development and production|Workload that can tolerate data loss up to 5-minutes due to service failures|
|Uptime SLA|99.99%|99.99%|99.99%|N/A while in preview|
|Backup retention|7 days|35 days|35 days|35 days|
|CPU|Low|Low, Medium, High|Medium, High|Medium|
|IO throughput|Low	| Medium | Order of magnitude higher than Standard|Same as Premium|
|IO latency|Higher than Premium|Higher than Premium|Lower than Basic and Standard|Same as Premium|
|Columnstore indexing and in-memory OLTP|N/A|N/A|Supported|Supported|

## Performance level and storage size limits

Performance levels are expressed in terms of Database Transaction Units (DTUs) for single databases and elastic Database Transaction Units (eDTUs) for elastic pools. For more on DTUs and eDTUs, see [What are DTUs and eDTUs?](sql-database-what-is-a-dtu.md).

### Single databases

|  | **Basic** | **Standard** | **Premium** | **Premium RS**|
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Maximum storage size* | 2 GB | 1 TB | 4 TB  | 1 TB  |
| Maximum DTUs | 5 | 3000 | 4000 | 1000 |
||||||

### Elastic pools

| | **Basic** | **Standard** | **Premium** | **Premium RS**|
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Maximum storage size per database*  | 2 GB | 1 TB | 1 TB | 1 TB |
| Maximum storage size per pool* | 156 GB | 4 TB | 4 TB | 1 TB |
| Maximum eDTUs per database | 5 | 3000 | 4000 | 1000 |
| Maximum eDTUs per pool | 1600 | 3000 | 4000 | 1000 |
| Maximum number of databases per pool | 500  | 500 | 100 | 100 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \* Storage sizes greater than the amount of included storage are in preview and extra costs apply. For details, see [SQL Database pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-database/). 
>
> \* In the Premium tier, more than 1 TB of storage is currently available in the following regions: US East2, West US, US Gov Virginia, West Europe, Germany Central, South East Asia, Japan East, Australia East, Canada Central, and Canada East. See [P11-P15 Current Limitations](sql-database-resource-limits.md#single-database-limitations-of-p11-and-p15-when-the-maximum-size-greater-than-1-tb).  
> 

For details on specific performance levels and storage size choices available, see [SQL Database resource limits](sql-database-resource-limits.md).
