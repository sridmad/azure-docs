# Use CLI to monitor and scale a single SQL database

This Azure CLI script example scales a single Azure SQL database to a different performance level after querying the size information of the database. 

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this topic requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/sql-database/monitor-and-scale-database/monitor-and-scale-database.sh "Monitor and scale single SQL Database")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#az_group_create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az sql server create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/server#az_sql_server_create) | Creates a logical server that hosts a database. |
| [az sql db show-usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/db#az_sql_db_show_usage) | Shows the size usage information for a database. |
| [az sql db update](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/sql/db#az_sql_db_update) | Updates database properties (such as the service tier or performance level) or moves a database into, out of, or between elastic pools. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#az_vm_extension_set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
