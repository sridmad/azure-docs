# Introduction to a SQL Database multi-tenant SaaS app example

The *Wingtip SaaS* application is a sample multi-tenant app, that demonstrates the unique advantages of SQL Database. The app uses a database-per-tenant, SaaS application pattern, to service multiple tenants. The app is designed to showcase features of Azure SQL Database that enable SaaS scenarios, including several SaaS design and management patterns. To quickly get up and running, the Wingtip SaaS app deploys in less than five minutes!

Application source code and management scripts are available in the [WingtipSaaS](https://github.com/Microsoft/WingtipSaaS) github repo. To run the scripts, [download the Learning Modules folder](#download-and-unblock-the-wingtip-saas-scripts) to your local computer.

## Application architecture

The Wingtip SaaS app uses the database-per-tenant model, and uses SQL elastic pools to maximize efficiency. For provisioning and mapping tenants to their data, a catalog database is used. The core Wingtip SaaS application, uses a pool with three sample tenants, plus the catalog database. Completing many of the Wingtip SaaS tutorials result in add-ons to the intial deployment, by introducing analytic databases, cross-database schema management, etc.

While going through the tutorials and working with the app, it is important to focus on the SaaS patterns as they relate to the data tier. In other words, focus on the data tier, and don't over analyze the app itself. Understanding the implementation of these SaaS patterns is key to implementing these patterns in your applications, while considering any necessary modifications for your specific business requirements.

## SQL Database Wingtip SaaS tutorials

After deploying the app, explore the following tutorials that build upon the initial deployment. These tutorials explore common SaaS patterns that take advantage of built-in features of SQL Database, SQL Data Warehouse, and other Azure services. Tutorials include PowerShell scripts, with detailed explanations that greatly simplify understanding, and implementing the same SaaS management patterns in your applications.
