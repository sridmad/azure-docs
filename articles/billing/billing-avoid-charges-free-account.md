# Avoid getting charged for your Azure free account

Azure free account gives you $200 in Azure credits to spend within the first 30 days and 12 months of free services. For more information, see [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and [Create free services with Azure free account](billing-create-free-services-included-free-account.md). Depending on the status of your credit, you may use your credit or get charged for usage not covered through Azure free account benefits.

## You still have active Azure free account credit 
If you still have Azure credit that hasn't expired, you use the credit to pay for any charges incurred on your Azure free account.

## Your credit ran out or has expired
If your credit ran out or expired at the end of 30 days, Azure disables your subscription. You are not charged unless you enable your subscription by upgrading it to a pay as you go subscription. For more information, see [Upgrade your Free Trial Azure subscription to Pay-As-You-Go](billing-upgrade-azure-subscription.md). Once you upgrade your subscription, you get charged pay as you go rates for any charges incurred on your Azure free account. 


Let's look at some of the reasons you can incur charges on your Azure free account.


### Your usage exceeds the limits of free services included with Azure free account

You get a limited quantity of free services each month with your Azure free account. The free quantity expires at the end of the month and doesn't roll over to the next month. For example, you get 5 GB of File storage each month. If in a month, you only use 2 GB, the remaining 3 GB doesn't roll over to the next month. To avoid getting charged, keep your usage within the limits. To learn about limits of free services, see [What is Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/). To check your free service usage, see [Check usage of free services included with Azure free Account](billing-check-free-service-usage.md). 

### You are using services not included with Azure free account

You get charged pay as you go rates for using services, which are not included for free with your Azure free account. To learn about services included with free account, see [What is Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/free-account-faq/). You can check your usage either on the Azure portal or through the Azure usage file. To learn more, see [Regularly check the portal for cost breakdown and burn rate](billing-getting-started.md#costs) and [Download usage from the Account Center](billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date.md). 

### You have reached the end of your Azure free account benefits

Your Azure free account benefits expire at the end of 12 months. After that, Azure charges you pay as you go rates for the services you are using. You can use the Azure portal to delete the resources for the services that you don't use. If you donâ€™t intend to use any Azure service, you can [cancel your subscription](billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription.md).
