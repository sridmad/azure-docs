# Understand Reserved Instance usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription

Understand utilization of Reserved Instance by using the ReservationId from [Reservation page](https://portal.azure.com/?microsoft_azure_marketplace_ItemHideKey=Reservations&Microsoft_Azure_Reservations=true#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Reservations/ReservationsBrowseBlade ) and  the usage file from [Azure Accounts portal.](https://account.azure.com)


>[!NOTE]
>This article does not apply to EA customers. If you are an EA customer, see [Understand  Reserved Instance usage for your Enterprise enrollment.](billing-understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md) 
>This article also assumes that reservation is applied to a single subscription. If the reservation is applied to more than one subscription, reservation benefit may span multiple usage csv files. 

For the following section, assume that you are running a Standard_DS1_v2 Windows VM in east US region and your reservation information looks like the following table:

| Field | Value |
|---| :---: |
|ReservationId |8117adfb-1d94-4675-be2b-f3c1bca808b6|
|Quantity |1|
|SKU | Standard_DS1_v2|
|Region | eastus |

## Reservation application

The hardware portion of the VM is covered because the deployed VM matches the reservation attributes. To see what Windows software isn't covered by the Reserved Instance, go to [Azure Reserve VM Instances Windows software costs.](billing-reserved-instance-windows-software-costs.md)

### Statement section of csv
This section of your csv shows the total  usage for your reservation. Apply the filter on Meter Sub-category field that contains "Reservation-" and your data looks like the following screenshot:
![Direct Statement Reservation](./media/billing-understand-reserved-instance-usage/billing-payg-reserved-instance-csv-statements.png)

Reservation-Base VM line has the total number of hours that are covered by the Reservation. This line is $0.00 because the Reserved Instance covers it. Reservation-Windows Svr (1 Core) line covers the cost of Windows software.

### Daily usage section of csv
Filter on additional info and type in your Reservation ID. The following screenshot shows the fields related to the reservation. 

![Daily usage charges](./media/billing-understand-reserved-instance-usage/billing-payg-reserved-instance-csv-details.png)

1. ReservationId in Additional Info field is the reservation that was used to apply benefit to the VM.
2. ConsumptionMeter is the Meter Id for the VM.
3. Reservation-Base VM Meter Sub-category line represents the $0 cost line in statement section. Cost of running this VM is already paid by the reservation.
4. This is the Meter Id for Reservation. Cost of this meter is $0. Any VM that qualifies for Reserved Instance has this MeterId in the csv to account for the cost. 
5. Standard_DS1_v2 is one vCPU VM and the VM is deployed without Azure Hybrid Benefit. Therefore, this meter covers the extra charge of Windows software. See [Azure Reserve VM Instances Windows software costs.](billing-reserved-instance-windows-software-costs.md) to find the meter corresponding to D series 1 core VM. If Azure Hybrid Benefit is used, this extra charge is not applied.
