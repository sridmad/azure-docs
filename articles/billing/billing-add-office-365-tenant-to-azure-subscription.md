# Link an Office 365 tenant to an Azure subscription
Link your separate Azure and Office 365 subscriptions so that you can access the Office 365 tenant from your Azure subscription. To link your subscriptions, sign in to Azure with the Azure service administrator account, add a directory, and add the Office 365 work or school accounts to the Azure Active Directory tenant.

**Want to move your existing Azure subscription to your Office 365 work or school account?** If you signed up for Azure using a personal Microsoft account, and want to use it or sign in with your Office 365 account, we strongly recommend transferring the subscription. See [Transfer Azure subscription ownership to another account](billing-subscription-transfer.md). 

**Want to sign up for Azure using Office 365?** See [Sign up for Azure with Office 365 account](billing-use-existing-office-365-account-azure-subscription.md). 

## Before you begin
* You must have the credentials of the Azure subscription service administrator. Co-administrator accounts can't do some of the steps in this article. To change your service administrator, see [How to add or change Azure administrator roles](billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md#change-service-administrator-for-a-subscription).
* You must have the credentials of a global administrator of the Office 365 tenant.
* The email address of the service administrator must not be in the Office 365 tenant.
* The email address of the service administrator must not match that of any global administrator of the Office 365 tenant.
* If you use an email address that is both a Microsoft account and an organizational account, temporarily change the service administrator of your Azure subscription to use another Microsoft account. You can create a Microsoft account at the [Microsoft account signup page](https://signup.live.com/).

## Link Office 365 tenant to Azure subscription
To associate the Office 365 tenant to the Azure subscription, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Office 365 tenant to your Azure subscription

1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) with the service administrator credentials.

2. In the left pane, select **ACTIVE DIRECTORY**. You shouldn't see the Office 365 tenant. If you see it, skip to [Step 2: Change the directory associated with the Azure subscription](#Step2).

The warning you receive only mentions the removal of co-administrators.
