## Troubleshooting

This section describes how to troubleshoot common issues with Azure Databricks.

### Issue: This subscription is not registered to use the namespace ‘Microsoft.Databricks’

**Error message**

This subscription is not registered to use the namespace ‘Microsoft.Databricks’. See https://aka.ms/rps-not-found for how to register subscriptions. (Code: MissingSubscriptionRegistration)

**Solution**

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Subscriptions**,  the subscription you are using, and then click **Resource providers**. 
3. In the list of resource providers, against **Microsoft.Databricks**, click **Register**. You must have Contributor or Owner role on the subscription to register the resource provider.


### Issue: Your account {email} does not have Owner or Contributor role on the Databricks workspace resource in the Azure portal.

**Error message**

Your account {email} does not have Owner or Contributor role on the Databricks workspace resource in the Azure portal. This error can also occur if you are a guest user in the tenant. Ask your administrator to grant you access or add you as A user directly in the Databricks workspace. 

**Solution**

Following are a couple of solutions to this issue:

* To initialize the tenant, you must be logged in as a regular user of the tenant, not a guest user. You must also have Contributor role on the Databricks workspace resource. You can grant a user access from the **Access control (IAM)** tab within your Azure Databricks workspace in the Azure portal.

* This error may also occur if your email domain name is assigned to multiple Active Directories. To work around this issue, create a new user in the Active Directory containing the subscription with your Databricks workspace.

    a. In the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory, click **Users and Groups**, click **Add a user**.

    b. Add a user with an `@<tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com` email instead of @<your_domain> email. You can find the <tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com associated with your Active Directory in the **Custom Domains** under Azure Active Directory in the Azure portal.
    
    c. Grant this new user **Contributor** role on the Databricks workspace resource.
    
    d. Log in to the Azure portal with the new user and find the Databricks workspace.
    
    e. Launch the Databricks workspace as this user.


### Issue: Your account {email} has not been registered in Databricks 

**Solution**

If you did not create the workspace and you are added as a user of the workspace, contact the person that created the workspace to add you using the Azure Databricks Admin Console. For instructions, see [Adding and managing users](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/administration-guide/admin-settings/users.html). If you created the workspace and still you get this error, try clicking “Initialize Workspace” again from the Azure portal.

### Issue: Cloud Provider Launch Failure (PublicIPCountLimitReached): A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster

**Error message**

Cloud Provider Launch Failure: A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster. See the Databricks guide for more information. Azure error code: PublicIPCountLimitReached. Azure error message: Cannot create more than 60 public IP addresses for this subscription in this region.

**Solution**

Azure Databricks clusters use one public IP Address per node. If your subscription has already used all its public IPs, you should [request to increase the quota](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/resource-manager-core-quotas-request). Choose **Quota** as the **Issue Type**, **Networking: ARM** as the **Quota Type**, and request a Public IP Address quota increase in **Details**. For example, if your limit is currently 60 and you want to create a 100 node cluster, request a limit increase to 160.

### Issue: Cloud Provider Launch Failure (MissingSubscriptionRegistration): A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster

**Error message**

Cloud Provider Launch Failure: A cloud provider error was encountered while setting up the cluster. See the Databricks guide for more information.
Azure error code: MissingSubscriptionRegistration
Azure error message: The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.Compute'. See https://aka.ms/rps-not-found for how to register subscriptions

**Solution**

1. Go to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Subscriptions**,  the subscription you are using, and then click **Resource providers**. 
3. In the list of resource providers, against **Microsoft.Compute**, click **Register**. You must have Contributor or Owner role on the subscription to register the resource provider.
