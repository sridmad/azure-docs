# Connect with Excel

Once you've created a server in Azure, and deployed a tabular model to it, you're ready to connect and begin exploring data.


## Connect in Excel

Connecting to a server in Excel is supported by using Get Data in Excel 2016. Connecting by using the Import Table Wizard in Power Pivot is not supported. 

**To connect in Excel 2016**

1. In Excel 2016, on the **Data** ribbon, click **Get External Data** > **From Other Sources** > **From Analysis Services**.

2. In the Data Connection Wizard, in **Server name**, enter the server name including protocol and URI. Then, in **Logon credentials**, select **Use the following User Name and Password**, and then type the organizational user name, for example nancy@adventureworks.com, and password.

3. In **Select Database and Table**, select the database and model or perspective, and then click **Finish**.
