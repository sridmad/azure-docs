# Azure Analysis Services - Adventure Works tutorial

[!INCLUDE[analysis-services-appliesto-aas-sql2017-later](../../../includes/analysis-services-appliesto-aas-sql2017-later.md)]

This tutorial provides lessons on how to create and deploy a tabular model at the 1400 compatibility level by using [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt).  

If you're new to Analysis Services and tabular modeling, completing this tutorial is the quickest way to learn how to create and deploy a basic tabular model. Once you have the prerequisites in-place, it should take between two to three hours to complete.  
  
## What you learn   
  
-   How to create a new tabular model project at the **1400 compatibility level** in SSDT.
  
-   How to import data from a relational database into a tabular model project.  
  
-   How to create and manage relationships between tables in the model.  
  
-   How to create calculated columns, measures, and Key Performance Indicators that help users analyze critical business metrics.  
  
-   How to create and manage perspectives and hierarchies that help users more easily browse model data by providing business and application-specific viewpoints.  
  
-   How to create partitions that divide table data into smaller logical parts that can be processed independent from other partitions.  
  
-   How to secure model objects and data by creating roles with user members.  
  
-   How to deploy a tabular model to an **Azure Analysis Services** server or an on-premises SQL Server 2017 Analysis Services server.  
  
## Prerequisites  
To complete this tutorial, you need:  
  
-   An Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server 2017 Analysis Services instance to deploy your model to. Sign up for a free [Azure Analysis Services trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/analysis-services/) and [create a server](../analysis-services-create-server.md). Or, sign up and download [SQL Server 2017 Community Technology Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-vnext-ctp). 

-   A SQL Server Data Warehouse or Azure SQL Data Warehouse with the [AdventureWorksDW2014 sample database](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=335807). This sample database includes the data necessary to complete this tutorial. Download [SQL Server free editions](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads). Or, sign up for a free [Azure SQL Database trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/). 

    **Important:** If you install the sample database on an on-premises SQL Server, and you deploy your model to an Azure Analysis Services server, an [On-premises data gateway](../analysis-services-gateway.md) is required.

-   The latest version of [SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx).

-   The latest version of [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).    

-   A client application such as [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) or Excel. 

## Scenario  
This tutorial is based on Adventure Works Cycles, a fictitious company. Adventure Works is a large, multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes bicycles, parts, and accessories to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. The company employs 500 workers. Additionally, Adventure Works employs several regional sales teams throughout its market base. Your project is to create a tabular model for sales and marketing users to analyze Internet sales data in the AdventureWorksDW database.  
  
To complete the tutorial, you must complete various lessons. In each lesson, there are tasks. Completing each task in order is necessary for completing the lesson. While in a particular lesson there may be several tasks that accomplish a similar outcome, but how you complete each task is slightly different. This method shows there is often more than one way to complete a task, and to challenge you by using skills you've learned in previous lessons and tasks.  
  
The purpose of the lessons is to guide you through authoring a basic tabular model by using many of the features included in SSDT. Because each lesson builds upon the previous lesson, you should complete the lessons in order.
  
This tutorial does not provide lessons about managing a server in Azure portal, managing a server or database by using SSMS, or using a client application to browse model data.
