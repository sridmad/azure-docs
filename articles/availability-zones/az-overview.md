# Overview of Availability Zones in Azure (Preview)

Availability Zones help to protect you from datacenter-level failures. They are located inside an Azure region, and each one has its own independent power source, network, and cooling. To ensure resiliency, there's a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions. The physical and logical separation of Availability Zones within a region protects applications and data from zone-level failures.
