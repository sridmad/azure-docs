# Plan an Azure deployment
From setting up shop in China to hosting your workload on Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet), your organization has many decisions to make:
- Plan ahead for the [ICP filing and registration](/azure/china/china-overview-policies) process.
- Check the service-level agreement (SLA) offered by [21Vianet](/azure/china/china-overview-operations), the Azure operator.
- Ensure your Azure application or workload [complies](/azure/china/china-overview-policies) with national, regional, and industry-specific requirements.
- Learn what [partners](/azure/china/china-resources-partners) and the Azure marketplace offer in China.
- [Develop](/azure/china/china-get-started-developer-guide), [test](/azure/china/china-how-to-manage-performance), and [host](/azure/china/china-overview-service-hosting) your application on Azure.
