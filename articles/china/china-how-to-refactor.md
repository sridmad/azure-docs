# Refactor and migrate an application to Azure
If your application or workloads run in another cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Ali Cloud, you can migrate them to Microsoft Azure operated by 21Vianet (Azure China 21Vianet) using [Azure Site Recovery](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/site-recovery/). Designed to provide automated disaster recovery, this service can be used to migrate VMware and Hyper-V virtual machines from other cloud providers.

For more information, see [Migrate virtual machines in AWS to Azure with Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-migrate-aws-to-azure).
