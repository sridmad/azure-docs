# Azure Automation watcher tasks enable you to respond to events happening in your local datacenter

In this tutorial, you learn how to create a new watcher task to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a watcher runbook that looks for new files in a directory.
> * Create an Automation variable to keep the last time a file was processed by the watcher.
> * Create an action runbook that is called when the watcher runbook finds a new file.
> * Create a watcher task that selects the watcher runbook and action runbook.
> * Trigger a watcher by adding a new file to a directory.
> * Inspect the output from the action runbook that shows information on the new file.	

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, the following are required.

+ [Automation account](automation-offering-get-started.md) to hold the watcher and action runbooks and the Watcher Task.
+ A [hybrid runbook worker](automation-hybrid-runbook-worker.md) where the watcher task runs.
