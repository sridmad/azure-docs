# Forward job status and job streams from Automation to Log Analytics (OMS)
Automation can send runbook job status and job streams to your Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS) Log Analytics workspace.  Job logs and job streams are visible in the Azure portal, or with PowerShell, for individual jobs and this allows you to perform simple investigations. Now with Log Analytics you can:

* Get insight on your Automation jobs
* Trigger an email or alert based on your runbook job status (for example, failed or suspended)
* Write advanced queries across your job streams
* Correlate jobs across Automation accounts
* Visualize your job history over time     

## Prerequisites and deployment considerations
To start sending your Automation logs to Log Analytics, you need:

1. The November 2016 or later release of [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs/) (v2.3.0).
2. A Log Analytics workspace. For more information, see [Get started with Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-get-started.md). 
3. The ResourceId for your Azure Automation account

To find the ResourceId for your Azure Automation account and Log Analytics workspace, run the following PowerShell:

```powershell
# Find the ResourceId for the Automation Account
Find-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.Automation/automationAccounts"

# Find the ResourceId for the Log Analytics workspace
Find-AzureRmResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces"
```

If you have multiple Automation accounts, or workspaces, in the output of the preceding commands, find the *Name* you need to configure and copy the value for *ResourceId*.

If you need to find the *Name* of your Automation account, in the Azure portal select your Automation account from the **Automation account** blade and select **All settings**.  From the **All settings** blade, under **Account Settings** select **Properties**.  In the **Properties** blade, you can note these values.<br> ![Automation Account properties](media/automation-manage-send-joblogs-log-analytics/automation-account-properties.png).

## Set up integration with Log Analytics
1. On your computer, start **Windows PowerShell** from the **Start** screen.  
2. Copy and paste the following PowerShell, and edit the value for the `$workspaceId` and `$automationAccountId`.  For the `-Environment` parameter, valid values are *AzureCloud* or *AzureUSGovernment* depending on the cloud environment you are working in.     

```powershell
[cmdletBinding()]
	Param
	(
		[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        [ValidateSet("AzureCloud","AzureUSGovernment")]
        [string]$Environment="AzureCloud"
	)

#Check to see which cloud environment to sign into.
Switch ($Environment)
   {
       "AzureCloud" {Login-AzureRmAccount}
       "AzureUSGovernment" {Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment} 
   }

# if you have one Log Analytics workspace you can use the following command to get the resource id of the workspace
$workspaceId = (Get-AzureRmOperationalInsightsWorkspace).ResourceId

$automationAccountId = "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/ec11ca67-1234-421e-5678-c25/RESOURCEGROUPS/DEMO/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION/ACCOUNTS/DEMO" 

Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId $automationAccountId -WorkspaceId $workspaceId -Enabled $true

```

After running this script, you will see records in Log Analytics within 10 minutes of new JobLogs or JobStreams being written.

To see the logs, run the following query in Log Analytics log search:
`Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION"`

### Verify configuration
To confirm that your Automation account is sending logs to your Log Analytics workspace, check that diagnostics are set correctly on the Automation account using the following PowerShell:

```powershell
[cmdletBinding()]
	Param
	(
		[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        [ValidateSet("AzureCloud","AzureUSGovernment")]
        [string]$Environment="AzureCloud"
	)

#Check to see which cloud environment to sign into.
Switch ($Environment)
   {
       "AzureCloud" {Login-AzureRmAccount}
       "AzureUSGovernment" {Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureUSGovernment} 
   }
# if you have one Log Analytics workspace you can use the following command to get the resource id of the workspace
$workspaceId = (Get-AzureRmOperationalInsightsWorkspace).ResourceId

$automationAccountId = "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/ec11ca67-1234-421e-5678-c25/RESOURCEGROUPS/DEMO/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION/ACCOUNTS/DEMO" 

Get-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId $automationAccountId
```

In the output ensure that:
+ Under *Logs*, the value for *Enabled* is *True*
+ The value of *WorkspaceId* is set to the ResourceId of your Log Analytics workspace


## Log Analytics records
Diagnostics from Azure Automation creates two types of records in Log Analytics and are tagged as **Type=AzureDiagnostics**.

## Viewing Automation Logs in Log Analytics
Now that you have started sending your Automation job logs to Log Analytics, letâ€™s see what you can do with these logs inside Log Analytics.

To see the logs, run the following query:
`Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION"`

### Send an email when a runbook job fails or suspends
One of our top customer asks is for the ability to send an email or a text when something goes wrong with a runbook job.   

To create an alert rule, you start by creating a log search for the runbook job records that should invoke the alert.  Click the **Alert** button to create and configure the alert rule.

1. From the Log Analytics Overview page, click **Log Search**.
2. Create a log search query for your alert by typing the following search into the query field:  `Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION" Category=JobLogs (ResultType=Failed OR ResultType=Suspended)`  You can also group by the RunbookName by using: `Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION" Category=JobLogs (ResultType=Failed OR ResultType=Suspended) | measure Count() by RunbookName_s`   

   If you have set up logs from more than one Automation account or subscription to your workspace, you can group your alerts by subscription and Automation account.  Automation account name can be derived from the Resource field in the search of JobLogs.  
3. To open the **Add Alert Rule** screen, click **Alert** at the top of the page. For further details on the options to configure the alert, see [Alerts in Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-alerts.md#alert-rules).

### Find all jobs that have completed with errors
In addition to alerting on failures, you can find when a runbook job has a non-terminating error. In these cases PowerShell produces an error stream, but the non-terminating errors do not cause your job to suspend or fail.    

1. In your Log Analytics workspace, click **Log Search**.
2. In the query field, type `Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION" Category=JobStreams StreamType_s=Error | measure count() by JobId_g` and then click **Search**.

### View job streams for a job
When you are debugging a job, you may also want to look into the job streams.  The following query shows all the streams for a single job with GUID 2ebd22ea-e05e-4eb9-9d76-d73cbd4356e0:   

`Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION" Category=JobStreams JobId_g="2ebd22ea-e05e-4eb9-9d76-d73cbd4356e0" | sort TimeGenerated | select ResultDescription`

### View historical job status
Finally, you may want to visualize your job history over time.  You can use this query to search for the status of your jobs over time.

`Type=AzureDiagnostics ResourceProvider="MICROSOFT.AUTOMATION" Category=JobLogs NOT(ResultType="started") | measure Count() by ResultType interval 1hour`

## Summary
By sending your Automation job status and stream data to Log Analytics, you can get better insight into the status of your Automation jobs by:
+ Setting up alerts to notify you when there is an issue
+ Using custom views and search queries to visualize your runbook results, runbook job status, and other related key indicators or metrics.  

Log Analytics provides greater operational visibility to your Automation jobs and can help address incidents quicker.
