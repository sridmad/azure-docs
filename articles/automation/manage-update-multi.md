# Manage updates for multiple machines

You can use update management to manage updates and patches for your Windows and Linux virtual machines. From your [Azure Automation](automation-offering-get-started.md) account, you can:

- Onboard virtual machines.
- Assess the status of available updates.
- Schedule installation of required updates.
- Review deployment results to verify that updates were applied successfully to all virtual machines for which update management is enabled.

## Prerequisites

To use update management, you need:

* An Azure Automation Run As account. For instructions on how to create one, see
[Getting started with Azure Automation](automation-offering-get-started.md).

* A virtual machine or computer with one of the supported operating systems installed.

## Supported operating systems

Update management is supported on the following operating systems.

### Windows

* Windows Server 2008 and later, and update deployments against Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later. Server Core and Nano Server installation options are not supported.

  Support for deploying updates to Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 requires .NET Framework 4.5 and Windows Management Framework 5.0 or later.

* Windows client operating systems are not supported.

Windows agents must either be configured to communicate with a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server or have access to Microsoft Update.

> [!NOTE]
> System Center Configuration Manager cannot manage the Windows agent concurrently.
>

### Linux

* CentOS 6 (x86/x64) and 7 (x64)  
* Red Hat Enterprise 6 (x86/x64) and 7 (x64)  
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86/x64) and 12 (x64)  
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and newer (x86/x64)   

> [!NOTE]  
> To prevent updates from being applied outside a maintenance window on Ubuntu, reconfigure the Unattended-Upgrade package to disable automatic updates. For more information, see the [Automatic Updates topic in the Ubuntu Server Guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/automatic-updates.html).

Linux agents must have access to an update repository.

This solution doesn't support an OMS Agent for Linux configured to report to multiple Operations Management Suite workspaces.

## Enable update management for Azure virtual machines

1. In the Azure portal, open the Automation account.
2. In the left pane, select **Update management**.
3. At the top of the window, select **Add Azure VM**.
   ![Add Azure VM tab](./media/manage-update-multi/update-onboard-vm.png)
4. Select a virtual machine to onboard. The **Enable Update Management** dialog box appears.
5. Select **Enable**.

   ![Enable Update Management dialog box](./media/manage-update-multi/update-enable.png)

Update management is enabled for your virtual machine.

## Enable update management for non-Azure virtual machines and computers

For instructions on how to enable update management for non-Azure Windows virtual machines and computers, see [Connect Windows computers to the Log Analytics service in Azure](../log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents.md).

For instructions on how to enable update management for non-Azure Linux virtual machines and computers, see [Connect your Linux computers to Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-agent-linux.md).

## View an update assessment

After update management is enabled, the **Update management** dialog box appears. You can see a list of missing updates on the **Missing updates** tab.

## Collect data

Agents installed on virtual machines and computers collect data about updates and send it to Azure update management.

### Supported agents

The following table describes the connected sources that this solution supports:

| Connected source | Supported | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows agents |Yes |Update management collects information about system updates from Windows agents and initiates installation of required updates. |
| Linux agents |Yes |Update management collects information about system updates from Linux agents and initiates installation of required updates on supported distros. |
| Operations Manager management group |Yes |Update management collects information about system updates from agents in a connected management group. |
| Azure storage account |No |Azure storage does not include information about system updates. |

### Collection frequency

For each managed Windows computer, a scan runs twice a day. Every 15 minutes, the Windows API is called to query for the last update time to determine if the status has changed. If so, a compliance scan starts. For each managed Linux computer, a scan runs every 3 hours.

It can take 30 minutes to 6 hours for the dashboard to display updated data from managed computers.

## Schedule an update deployment

To install updates, schedule a deployment that follows your release schedule and service window.
You can choose which update types to include in the deployment. For example, you can include critical or security updates and exclude update rollups.

Schedule a new update deployment for one or more virtual machines by selecting **Schedule update deployment** at the top of the **Update management** dialog box. 
In the **New update deployment** pane, specify the following:

* **Name**: Provide a unique name to identify the update deployment.
* **OS Type**: Select Windows or Linux.
* **Computers to update**: Select the virtual machines that you want to update.

  !["New update deployment" pane](./media/manage-update-multi/update-select-computers.png)

* **Update classification**: Select the types of software that the update deployment will include. The classification types are:
  * Critical updates
  * Security updates
  * Update rollups
  * Feature packs
  * Service packs
  * Definition updates
  * Tools
  * Updates
* **Schedule settings**: You can accept the default date and time, which is 30 minutes after the current time. Or you can specify a different time.
   You can also specify whether the deployment occurs once or on a recurring schedule. To set up a recurring schedule, select the **Recurring** option under **Recurrence**.

   ![Schedule Settings dialog box](./media/manage-update-multi/update-set-schedule.png)

* **Maintenance window (minutes)**: Specify the period of time for when you want the update deployment to occur. This setting helps ensure that changes are performed within your defined service windows.

After you finish configuring the schedule, return to the status dashboard by selecting the **Create** button. The **Scheduled** table shows the deployment schedule that you just created.

> [!WARNING]
> For updates that require a restart, the virtual machine will restart automatically.

## View results of an update deployment

After the scheduled deployment starts, you can see the status for that deployment on the **Update deployments** tab in the **Update management** dialog box.
If the deployment is currently running, its status is **In progress**. After the deployment finishes successfully, it changes to **Succeeded**.
If one or more updates fail in the deployment, the status is **Partially failed**.

![Status of update deployment](./media/manage-update-multi/update-view-results.png)

To see the dashboard for an update deployment, select the completed deployment.

The **Update results** pane shows the total number of updates and the deployment results on the virtual machine.
The table to the right gives a detailed breakdown of each update and the installation results. Installation results can be one of the following values:

* Not attempted: The update was not installed because insufficient time was available, based on the defined maintenance window.
* Succeeded: The update succeeded.
* Failed: The update failed.

To see all log entries that the deployment created, select **All logs**.

To see the job stream of the runbook that manages the update deployment on the target virtual machine, select the **Output** tile.

To see detailed information about any errors from the deployment, select **Errors**.
