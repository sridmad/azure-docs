# Customize the remote monitoring preconfigured solution

This article provides information about how you can access the source code and customize the remote monitoring preconfigured solution. The article describes:

* The GitHub repositories that contain the source code and resources for the microservices that make up the preconfigured solution.
* Common customization scenarios such as adding a new device type.

## Project overview

### Implementations

The remote monitoring solution has both .NET and Java implementations. Both implementations provide similar functionality and rely on the same underlying Azure services. You can find the top-level GitHub repositories here:

* [.NET solution](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet)
* [Java solution](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-java)

### Microservices

If you are interested in a specific feature of the solution, you can access the GitHub repositories for each individual microservice. Each microservice implements a different part of the solution functionality. To learn more about the overall architecture, see [Remote monitoring preconfigured solution architecture](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-sample-walkthrough.md).

This table summarizes the current availability of each microservice for each language:

<!-- please add links for each of the repos in the table, you can find them here https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-team/wiki/Repositories-->

The Java solution currently uses the .NET authentication, simulation, and reverse proxy microservices. These microservices will be replaced by Java versions as soon as they become available.

## Presentation and visualization

The following sections describe options to customize the presentation and visualizations layer in the remote monitoring solution:

### Change the logo in the UI

The default deployment uses the Contoso company name and logo in the UI. To change these UI elements to display your company name and logo:

1. Use the following command to clone the Web UI repository:

    ```cmd/sh
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui.git
    ```

1. To change the company name, open the `src/common/lang.js` file in a text editor.

1. Locate the following line in the file:

    ```js
    CONTOSO: 'Contoso',
    ```

1. Replace `Contoso` with the name of your company. For example:

    ```js
    CONTOSO: 'YourCo',
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. To update the logo, add a new SVG file to the `assets/icons` folder. The existing logo is the `assets/icons/Contoso.svg` file.

1. Open the `src/components/layout/leftNav/leftNav.js` file in a text editor.

1. Locate the following line in the file:

    ```js
    import ContosoIcon from '../../../assets/icons/Contoso.svg';
    ```

1. Replace `Contoso.svg` with the name of your logo file. For example:

    ```js
    import ContosoIcon from '../../../assets/icons/YourCo.svg';
    ```

1. Locate the following line in the file:

    ```js
    alt="ContosoIcon"
    ```

1. Replace `ContosoIcon` with your `alt` text. For example:

    ```js
    alt="YourCoIcon"
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. To test the changes, you can run the updated `webui` on your local machine. To learn how to build and run the `webui` solution locally, see [Build, run and test locally](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui/blob/master/README.md#build-run-and-test-locally) in the  `webui` GitHub repository readme file.

1. To deploy your changes, see the [Developer Reference Guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/wiki/Developer-Reference-Guide).

### Add a new KPI to the Dashboard page

The following steps describe how to add a new KPI to display on the **Dashboard** page. The new KPI shows information about the number of alarms with specific status values as a pie chart:

1. Step 1

1. Step 2

### Customize the map

See the [Customize map](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/wiki/Developer-Reference-Guide#upgrade-map-key-to-see-devices-on-a-dynamic-map) page in GitHub for details of the map components in the solution.

<!--
### Customize the telemetry chart

See the [Customize telemetry chart](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/) page in GitHub for details of the telemetry chart components in the solution.

### Connect an external visualization tool

See the [Connect an external visualization tool](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/) page in GitHub for details of how to connect an external visualization tool.

### Duplicate an existing control

To duplicate an existing UI element such as a chart or alert, see the [Duplicate a control](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet/) page in GitHub.

-->

### Other customization options

To further modify the presentation and visualizations layer in the remote monitoring solution, you can edit the code. The relevant GitHub repositories are:

* [UIConfig (.NET)](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-ui-config-dotnet/)
* [UIConfig (Java)](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-ui-config-java/)
* [Azure PCS Remote Monitoring WebUI](https://github.com/Azure/pcs-remote-monitoring-webui)

## Device connectivity and streaming

The following sections describe options to customize the device connectivity and streaming layer in the remote monitoring solution. [Device models](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/wiki/Device-Models) describe the device types and telemetry in the solution. You use device models for both simulated and physical devices.

For an example of a physical device implementation, see [Connect your device to the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-connecting-devices-node.md).

If you are using a _physical device_, you must provide the client application with a device model that contains the device metadata and telemetry specification.

The following sections discuss using device models with simulated devices:

### Add a telemetry type

The device types in the Contoso demo solution specify the telemetry that each device type sends. To specify the additional telemetry types, a device can send telemetry definitions as metadata to the solution. If you use this format, the dashboard consumes your device telemetry and available methods dynamically and you don't need to modify the UI. Alternatively, you can modify the device type definition in the solution.

To learn how to add custom telemetry in the _device simulator_ microservice, see [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).

### Add a device type

The Contoso demo solution defines some sample device types. The solution enables you to define custom device types to meet your specific application requirements. For example, your company may use an industrial gateway as the primary device connected to the solution.

To create an accurate representation of your device, you need to modify the application that runs on your device to match the device requirements.

To learn how to add a new device type in the _device simulator_ microservice, see [Test your solution with simulated devices](iot-suite-remote-monitoring-test.md).

### Define custom methods for simulated devices

To learn how to define custom methods for simulated devices in the remote monitoring solution, see [Device Models](https://github.com/Azure/device-simulation-dotnet/wiki/%5BAPI-Specifications%5D-Device-Models) in the GitHub repository.
