# Create a custom rule in the remote monitoring preconfigured solution

## Introduction

In the preconfigured solutions, you can configure [rules that trigger when a telemetry value for a device reaches a specific threshold][lnk-builtin-rule]. [Use dynamic telemetry with the remote monitoring preconfigured solution][lnk-dynamic-telemetry] describes how you can add custom telemetry values, such as *ExternalTemperature* to your solution. This article shows you how to create custom rule for dynamic telemetry types in your solution.

This tutorial uses a simple Node.js simulated device to generate dynamic telemetry to send to the preconfigured solution back end. You then add custom rules in the **RemoteMonitoring** Visual Studio solution and deploy this customized back end to your Azure subscription.

To complete this tutorial, you need:

* An active Azure subscription. If you don’t have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial][lnk_free_trial].
* [Node.js][lnk-node] version 0.12.x or later to create a simulated device.
* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017 to modify the preconfigured solution back end with your new rules.

[!INCLUDE [iot-suite-v1-provision-remote-monitoring](../../includes/iot-suite-v1-provision-remote-monitoring.md)]

Make a note of the solution name you chose for your deployment. You need this solution name later in this tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [iot-suite-v1-send-external-temperature](../../includes/iot-suite-v1-send-external-temperature.md)]

You can stop the Node.js console app when you have verified that it is sending **ExternalTemperature** telemetry to the preconfigured solution. Keep the console window open because you run this Node.js console app again after you add the custom rule to the solution.

## Rule storage locations

Information about rules is persisted in two locations:

* **DeviceRulesNormalizedTable** table – This table stores a normalized reference to the rules defined by the solution portal. When the solution portal displays device rules, it queries this table for the rule definitions.
* **DeviceRules** blob – This blob stores all the rules defined for all registered devices and is defined as a reference input to the Azure Stream Analytics jobs.
 
When you update an existing rule or define a new rule in the solution portal, both the table and blob are updated to reflect the changes. The rule definition displayed in the portal comes from the table store, and the rule definition referenced by the Stream Analytics jobs comes from the blob. 

## Update the RemoteMonitoring Visual Studio solution

The following steps show you how to modify the RemoteMonitoring Visual Studio solution to include a new rule that uses the **ExternalTemperature** telemetry sent from the simulated device:

1. If you have not already done so, clone the **azure-iot-remote-monitoring** repository to a suitable location on your local machine using the following Git command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-remote-monitoring.git
    ```

2. In Visual Studio, open the RemoteMonitoring.sln file from your local copy of the **azure-iot-remote-monitoring** repository.

3. Open the file Infrastructure\Models\DeviceRuleBlobEntity.cs and add an **ExternalTemperature** property as follows:

    ```csharp
    public double? Temperature { get; set; }
    public double? Humidity { get; set; }
    public double? ExternalTemperature { get; set; }
    ```

4. In the same file, add an **ExternalTemperatureRuleOutput** property as follows:

    ```csharp
    public string TemperatureRuleOutput { get; set; }
    public string HumidityRuleOutput { get; set; }
    public string ExternalTemperatureRuleOutput { get; set; }
    ```

5. Open the file Infrastructure\Models\DeviceRuleDataFields.cs and add the following **ExternalTemperature** property after the existing **Humidity** property:

    ```csharp
    public static string ExternalTemperature
    {
        get { return "ExternalTemperature"; }
    }
    ```

6. In the same file, update the **_availableDataFields** method to include **ExternalTemperature** as follows:

    ```csharp
    private static List<string> _availableDataFields = new List<string>
    {                    
        Temperature, Humidity, ExternalTemperature
    };
    ```

7. Open the file Infrastructure\Repository\DeviceRulesRepository.cs and modify the **BuildBlobEntityListFromTableRows** method as follows:

    ```csharp
    else if (rule.DataField == DeviceRuleDataFields.Humidity)
    {
        entity.Humidity = rule.Threshold;
        entity.HumidityRuleOutput = rule.RuleOutput;
    }
    else if (rule.DataField == DeviceRuleDataFields.ExternalTemperature)
    {
      entity.ExternalTemperature = rule.Threshold;
      entity.ExternalTemperatureRuleOutput = rule.RuleOutput;
    }
    ```

## Rebuild and redeploy the solution.

You can now deploy the updated solution to your Azure subscription.

1. Open an elevated command prompt and navigate to the root of your local copy of the azure-iot-remote-monitoring repository.

2. To deploy your updated solution, run the following command substituting **{deployment name}** with the name of your preconfigured solution deployment that you noted previously:

    ```
    build.cmd cloud release {deployment name}
    ```

## Update the Stream Analytics job

When the deployment is complete, you can update the Stream Analytics job to use the new rule definitions.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group that contains your preconfigured solution resources. This resource group has the same name you specified for the solution during the deployment.

2. Navigate to the {deployment name}-Rules Stream Analytics job. 

3. Click **Stop** to stop the Stream Analytics job from running. (You must wait for the streaming job to stop before you can edit the query).

4. Click **Query**. Edit the query to include the **SELECT** statement for **ExternalTemperature**. The following sample shows the complete query with the new **SELECT** statement:

    ```
    WITH AlarmsData AS 
    (
    SELECT
         Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId AS DeviceId,
         'Temperature' as ReadingType,
         Stream.Temperature as Reading,
         Ref.Temperature as Threshold,
         Ref.TemperatureRuleOutput as RuleOutput,
         Stream.EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS [Time]
    FROM IoTTelemetryStream Stream
    JOIN DeviceRulesBlob Ref ON Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId = Ref.DeviceID
    WHERE
         Ref.Temperature IS NOT null AND Stream.Temperature > Ref.Temperature
     
    UNION ALL
     
    SELECT
         Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId AS DeviceId,
         'Humidity' as ReadingType,
         Stream.Humidity as Reading,
         Ref.Humidity as Threshold,
         Ref.HumidityRuleOutput as RuleOutput,
         Stream.EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS [Time]
    FROM IoTTelemetryStream Stream
    JOIN DeviceRulesBlob Ref ON Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId = Ref.DeviceID
    WHERE
         Ref.Humidity IS NOT null AND Stream.Humidity > Ref.Humidity
     
    UNION ALL
     
    SELECT
         Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId AS DeviceId,
         'ExternalTemperature' as ReadingType,
         Stream.ExternalTemperature as Reading,
         Ref.ExternalTemperature as Threshold,
         Ref.ExternalTemperatureRuleOutput as RuleOutput,
         Stream.EventEnqueuedUtcTime AS [Time]
    FROM IoTTelemetryStream Stream
    JOIN DeviceRulesBlob Ref ON Stream.IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId = Ref.DeviceID
    WHERE
         Ref.ExternalTemperature IS NOT null AND Stream.ExternalTemperature > Ref.ExternalTemperature
    )
     
    SELECT *
    INTO DeviceRulesMonitoring
    FROM AlarmsData
     
    SELECT *
    INTO DeviceRulesHub
    FROM AlarmsData
    ```

5. Click **Save** to change the updated rule query.

6. Click **Start** to start the Stream Analytics job running again.

## Add your new rule in the dashboard

You can now add the **ExternalTemperature** rule to a device in the solution dashboard.

1. Navigate to the solution portal.

2. Navigate to the **Devices** panel.

3. Locate the custom device you created that sends **ExternalTemperature** telemetry and on the **Device Details** panel, click **Add Rule**.

4. Select **ExternalTemperature** in **Data Field**.

5. Set **Threshold** to 56. Then click **Save and view rules**.

6. Return to the dashboard to view the alarm history.

7. In the console window you left open, start the Node.js console app to begin sending **ExternalTemperature** telemetry data.

8. Notice that the **Alarm History** table shows new alarms when the new rule is triggered.
 
## Additional information

Changing the operator **>** is more complex and goes beyond the steps outlined in this tutorial. While you can change the Stream Analytics job to use whatever operator you like, reflecting that operator in the solution portal is a more complex task.
