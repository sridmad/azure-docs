Before you deploy the preconfigured solution to your Azure subscription, you must choose some configuration options:

1. Log on to [azureiotsuite.com](https://www.azureiotsuite.com) using your Azure account credentials, and click **+** to create a new solution:

1. On the **Create Remote Monitoring solution** page, enter a **Solution name** for your remote monitoring preconfigured solution.

1. Select a **Basic** or **Standard** deployment. If you are deploying the solution to learn how it works or to run a demonstration, choose the **Basic** option to minimize costs.

1. Choose either **Java** or **.NET** as the language. All the microservices are available as either Java or .NET implementations.

1. Review the **Solution details** panel for more information about your configuration choices.

1. Select the **Subscription** and **Region** you want to use to provision the solution.

1. Click **Create Solution** to begin the provisioning process. This process typically takes several minutes to run:

## Sign in to the preconfigured solution

When the provisioning process is complete, you can sign in to your remote monitoring preconfigured solution.
