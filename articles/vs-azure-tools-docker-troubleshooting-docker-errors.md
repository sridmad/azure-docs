# Troubleshoot Visual Studio 2017 development with Docker

When you're working with Visual Studio Tools for Docker, you may encounter issues while building or debugging your application. Below are some common troubleshooting steps.

## Volume sharing is not enabled. Enable volume sharing in the Docker CE for Windows settings  (Linux containers only)

To resolve this issue:

1. Right-click **Docker for Windows** in the notification area, and then select **Settings**.
1. Select **Shared Drives** and share the system drive along with the drive where the project resides.

> [!NOTE]
> If files appear shared, you may still need to click the "Reset credentials..." link at the bottom of the dialog in order to re-enable volume sharing.

## Unable to start debugging

One reason could be related to having stale debugging components in your user profile folder. Execute the following commands to remove these folders so that the latest debugging components are downloaded on the next debug session.

- del %userprofile%\vsdbg
- del %userprofile%\onecoremsvsmon

## Errors specific to networking when debugging your application

Try executing the script downloadable from [Cleanup Container Host Networking](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/Virtualization-Documentation/tree/master/windows-server-container-tools/CleanupContainerHostNetworking),
which will refresh the network-related components on your host machine.
