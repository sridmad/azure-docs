# Create a Batch account with the Azure CLI

This script creates an Azure Batch account and shows how various properties of the account 
can be queried and updated.

## Prerequisites

Install the Azure CLI using the instructions provided in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), if you have not already done so.

## Batch account sample script

When you create a Batch account, by default its compute nodes are assigned internally by the Batch
service. Allocated compute nodes will be subject to a separate core quota and the account can be 
authenticated either via Shared Key credentials or an Azure Active Dirctory token.

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/create-account/create-account.sh "Create Account")]

## Batch account using user subscription sample script

You can also opt to have Batch create its compute nodes in your own Azure subscription.
Accounts that allocate compute nodes into your subscription must be authenticated via an Azure Active
Directory token and the compute nodes allocated will count towards your subscription quota. To create 
an account in this mode, one must specify a Key Vault reference when creating the account.

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/create-account/create-account-user-subscription.sh  "Create Account using User Subscription")]

## Clean up deployment

After you run either of the above sample scripts, run the following command to remove the
resource group and all related resources (including Batch accounts, Azure Storage accounts and Azure key vaults).

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, Batch account, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command-specific documentation.

| [az batch account login](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/batch/account#az_batch_account_login) | Authenticates against the specified Batch account for further CLI interaction.  |
| [az storage account create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account#az_storage_account_create) | Creates a storage account. |
| [az keyvault create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault#az_keyvault_create) | Creates a key vault. |
| [az keyvault set-policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault#az_keyvault_set_policy) | Update the security policy of the specified key vault. |
