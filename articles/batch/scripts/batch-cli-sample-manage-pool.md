# Managing Azure Batch pools with Azure CLI

These script demonstrates some of the tools available in the Azure CLI to create and
manage pools of compute nodes in the Azure Batch service.

> [!NOTE]
> The commands in this sample create Azure virtual machines. Running VMs will accrue charges to your account. To minimize these charges, delete the VMs once you're done running the sample. See [Clean up pools](#clean-up-pools).

Batch pools can be configured in two ways, either with a Cloud Services configuration (Windows only),
or a Virtual Machine configuration (Windows and Linux). The sample scripts below show how to create pools with both configurations.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Azure CLI using the instructions provided in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), if you have not already done so.
- Create a Batch account if you don't already have one. See [Create a Batch account with the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/scripts/batch-cli-sample-create-account) for a sample script that creates an account.
- Configure an application to run from a start task if you haven't yet done so. See [Adding applications to Azure Batch with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/scripts/batch-cli-sample-add-application) for a sample script that creates an application and uploads an application package to Azure.

## Pool with cloud service configuration sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/manage-pool/manage-pool-windows.sh "Manage Cloud Services Pools")]

## Pool with virtual machine configuration sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/manage-pool/manage-pool-linux.sh "Manage Virtual Machine Pools")]

## Clean up pools

After you run the above sample script, run the following command to delete the pools.
```azurecli
az batch pool delete --pool-id mypool-windows
az batch pool delete --pool-id mypool-linux
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create and manipulate Batch pools.
Each command in the table links to command-specific documentation.
