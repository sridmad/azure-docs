## Introduction

In [Get started with IoT Hub device twins][lnk-twin-tutorial], you learned how to set device metadata from your solution back end using *tags*, report device conditions from a device app using *reported properties*, and query this information using a SQL-like language.

In this tutorial, you learn how to use the device twin's *desired properties* along with *reported properties*, to remotely configure device apps. More specifically, this tutorial shows how a device twin's reported and desired properties enable a multi-step configuration of a device application, and provide the visibility to the solution back end of the status of this operation across all devices. You can find more information regarding the role of device configurations in [Overview of device management with IoT Hub][lnk-dm-overview].

At a high level, using device twins enables the solution back end to specify the desired configuration for the managed devices, instead of sending specific commands. This puts the device in charge of setting up the best way to update its configuration (important in IoT scenarios where specific device conditions affect the ability to immediately carry out specific commands), while continually reporting to the solution back end the current state and potential error conditions of the update process. This pattern is instrumental to the management of large sets of devices, as it enables the solution back end to have full visibility of the state of the configuration process across all devices.

In this tutorial, the solution back end changes the telemetry configuration of a target device and, as a result of that, the device app follows a multi-step process to apply a configuration update (for example, requiring a software module restart, which this tutorial simulates with a simple delay).

The solution back end stores the configuration in the device twin's desired properties in the following way:

        {
            ...
            "properties": {
                ...
                "desired": {
                    "telemetryConfig": {
                        "configId": "{id of the configuration}",
                        "sendFrequency": "{config}"
                    }
                }
                ...
            }
            ...
        }

> Since configurations can be complex objects, they are assigned unique IDs (hashes or [GUIDs][lnk-guid]) to simplify their comparisons.

The device app reports its current configuration mirroring the desired property **telemetryConfig** in the reported properties:

        {
            "properties": {
                ...
                "reported": {
                    "telemetryConfig": {
                        "changeId": "{id of the current configuration}",
                        "sendFrequency": "{current configuration}",
                        "status": "Success",
                    }
                }
                ...
            }
        }

Note how the reported **telemetryConfig** has an additional property **status**, used to report the state of the configuration update process.

When a new desired configuration is received, the device app reports a pending configuration by changing the information:

        {
            "properties": {
                ...
                "reported": {
                    "telemetryConfig": {
                        "changeId": "{id of the current configuration}",
                        "sendFrequency": "{current configuration}",
                        "status": "Pending",
                        "pendingConfig": {
                            "changeId": "{id of the pending configuration}",
                            "sendFrequency": "{pending configuration}"
                        }
                    }
                }
                ...
            }
        }

Then, at some later time, the device app reports the success or failure of this operation by updating the above property.
Note how the solution back end is able, at any time, to query the status of the configuration process across all the devices.

This tutorial shows you how to:

* Create a simulated device app that receives configuration updates from the solution back end, and reports multiple updates as *reported properties* on the configuration update process.
* Create a back-end app that updates the desired configuration of a device, and then queries the configuration update process.
