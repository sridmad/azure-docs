## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources like function apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.

The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup`.  
If you are not using Cloud Shell, sign in first using `az login`.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
```
You generally create your resource group and the resources in a region near you. To see all supported locations for App Service plans, run the [az appservice list-locations](/cli/azure/appservice#az_appservice_list_locations) command.
