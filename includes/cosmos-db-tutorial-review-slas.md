2. Click through each of the tabs so you're aware of the metrics Azure Cosmos DB provides. 

    Each chart that's associated with the [Azure Cosmos DB Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/cosmos-db/) provides a line that shows if any of the SLAs have been violated. Azure Cosmos DB makes monitoring your SLAs transparent with this suite of metrics.
