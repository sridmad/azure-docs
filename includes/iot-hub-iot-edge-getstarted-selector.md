This article provides a detailed walkthrough of the [Hello World sample code][lnk-helloworld-sample] to illustrate the fundamental components of the [Azure IoT Edge][lnk-iot-edge] architecture. The sample uses the Azure IoT Edge to build a simple gateway that logs a "hello world" message to a file every five seconds.

This walkthrough covers:

* **Hello World sample architecture**: Describes how [Azure IoT Edge architectural concepts][lnk-edge-concepts] apply to the Hello World sample and how the components fit together.
* **How to build the sample**: The steps required to build the sample.
* **How to run the sample**: The steps required to run the sample. 
* **Typical output**: An example of the output to expect when you run the sample.
* **Code snippets**: A collection of code snippets to show how the Hello World sample implements key IoT Edge gateway components.


## Hello World sample architecture
The Hello World sample illustrates the concepts described in the previous section. The Hello World sample implements a IoT Edge gateway that has a pipeline made up of two IoT Edge modules:

* The *hello world* module creates a message every five seconds and passes it to the logger module.
* The *logger* module writes the messages it receives to a file.

As described in the previous section, the Hello World module does not pass messages directly to the logger module every five seconds. Instead, it publishes a message to the broker every five seconds.

The logger module receives the message from the broker and acts upon it, writing the contents of the message to a file.

The logger module only consumes messages from the broker, it never publishes new messages to the broker.

The preceding figure shows the architecture of the Hello World sample and the relative paths to the source files that implement different portions of the sample in the [repository][lnk-iot-edge]. Explore the code on your own, or use the code snippets in this article as a guide.
