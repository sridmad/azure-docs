When you create a virtual network gateway, you need to specify the gateway SKU that you want to use. Select the SKUs that satisfy your requirements based on the types of workloads, throughputs, features, and SLAs.

###  <a name="workloads"></a>Production *vs.* Dev-Test Workloads

Due to the differences in SLAs and feature sets, we recommend the following SKUs for production *vs.* dev-test:

| **Workload**                       | **SKUs**               |
| ---                                | ---                    |
| **Production, critical workloads** | VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3 |
| **Dev-test or proof of concept**   | Basic                  |
|                                    |                        |

If you are using the old SKUs, the production SKU recommendations are Standard and HighPerformance SKUs. For information on the old SKUs, see [Gateway SKUs (legacy SKUs)](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-skus-legacy.md).

###  <a name="feature"></a>Gateway SKU feature sets

The new gateway SKUs streamline the feature sets offered on the gateways:

| **SKU**| **Features**|
| ---    | ---         |
|**Basic**   | **Route-based VPN**: 10 tunnels with P2S; no RADIUS authentication; no IKEv2<br>**Policy-based VPN**: (IKEv1): 1 tunnel; no P2S|
| **VpnGw1, VpnGw2, and VpnGw3** | **Route-based VPN**: up to 30 tunnels (*), P2S, BGP, active-active, custom IPsec/IKE policy, ExpressRoute/VPN co-existence |
|        |             |

(*) You can configure "PolicyBasedTrafficSelectors" to connect a route-based VPN gateway (VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3) to multiple on-premises policy-based firewall devices. Refer to [Connect VPN gateways to multiple on-premises policy-based VPN devices using PowerShell](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-connect-multiple-policybased-rm-ps.md) for details.

###  <a name="resize"></a>Resizing gateway SKUs

1. You can resize between VpnGw1, VpnGw2, and VpnGw3 SKUs.
2. When working with the old gateway SKUs, you can resize between Basic, Standard, and HighPerformance SKUs.
2. You **cannot** resize from Basic/Standard/HighPerformance SKUs to the new VpnGw1/VpnGw2/VpnGw3 SKUs. You must, instead, [migrate](#migrate) to the new SKUs.
