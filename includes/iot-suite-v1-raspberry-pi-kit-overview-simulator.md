### Required software

You need SSH client on your desktop machine to enable you to remotely access the command line on the Raspberry Pi.

- Windows does not include an SSH client. We recommend using [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
- Most Linux distributions and Mac OS include the command-line SSH utility. For more information, see [SSH Using Linux or Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/unix.md).

### Required hardware

A desktop computer to enable you to connect remotely to the command line on the Raspberry Pi.

[Microsoft IoT Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 3][lnk-starter-kits] or equivalent components. This tutorial uses the following items from the kit:

- Raspberry Pi 3
- MicroSD Card (with NOOBS)
- A USB Mini cable
- An Ethernet cable
